Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[For anyone who has lost faith in the straight single player game in a world of online multiplayer madness, Assassin's Creed is that glimmer of hope you may be searching for. Finally there is a highly satisfying, and richly developed game that has been designed from the ground up to be a solo adventure like non other. This game shows you what a ""current gen"" one-player game can be and raises the bar for what is possible. You will find yourself with many moments of sheer excitement as you play through the twisting storyline that Assassin's Creed lays before you. Though it is not a perfect game, what little flaws it possesses are few and far between and don't really affect the overall enjoyment of this tale.In Assassin's Creed, you first find yourself playing the role of Desmond, a normal run of the mill bartender, who has been abducted by some highly industrialized tech company. You find out that they don't really want Desmond they just want his genetic memories, the memories of Altaïr. This is how the game works. You spend some time in a side story as Desmond, before being thrown into the real game to play as Altaïr, the main character. This works by Desmond in essence reliving a genetic memory of Altaïr through the means of an Animus, a machine which links to Desmond's brain and allows him to relive his ancestor's memories. With all that explanation aside, this two-sided story approach is really an interesting way of organizing the games seven chapters. In the beginning you really don't understand at all what is going on in the ""futuristic"" storyline, but that is intentional. As you progress you find out more and more, piecing together the puzzle of this side story. That leads us to the first big flaw in the game, the ending. I suppose it's not really a flaw, more bad taste in design. Anyone who is familiar with the ending to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back would have a good idea of the way this story ends. Basically it leads up to some big event that never happens. Since the story starts and ends in this side story that leaves it as a bit of a let down. However the main story of the game does have an ending, which is satisfying if not entirely predictable.On a gameplay standpoint this game delivers an intense experience. The mix of stealth and action really does go far beyond what Kojima first invented in MGS. To augment the sneaking around, you have four ways to deal with those pesky guards: secret blade, sword, fists, and the short sword/throwing knife combo. You will find a use of all of these as your skills advance. The secret blade is just amazingly satisfying to use and you won't easily tire of it. The game provides a nice cinematic camera touch in key moments when using this blade or performing an equally nice counter kill during a sword fight. Sword fights are not particularly impressive but they do add a different dynamic when faced with no other option and flow fairly smoothly. There are in fact moments when you must face off against a group of guards who enjoy surrounding you and wait for you to attempt to attack one, leaving you vulnerable for a slash across your backside. This can be frustrating for those who enjoy hack and slash sword fighting because timing is everything. If you are off with your timing you are going to get mowed down. This is an example of emphasizing details. The game plays a convincing role in realism details, such as the games use of maps. Basically you have to put together a map of an area from scratch. To do this you must climb to the top of the highest buildings in the city and surveying the surrounding area. That area is then added to a map. There are usually around 10 per area. You might think this to become tedious, and it would, if it wasn't so much fun to do. It truly is just fun to watch Altaïr scale this huge building, perch onto a ledge and take in the sights, before taking a ""leap"" into a conveniently placed pile of hay. That hay plays an important role in the game. The main idea here is stealth, get to know the area, gather information on the target, and assassinate all without being detected by the numerous city guards. There are three different states of awareness: the regular state which is basically no guards around, the yellow state where there is a guard around, and the red state when the guards are watching you. The first two states you really don't have to be that careful, it's the last one that will make them wise to what you are. If you do manage to alert them to your presence, and this is increasingly easy to do as you progress through the story, you only have two options: rely on your sword to take down anywhere from one to a dozen if not more guards that are pursuing you until you are no longer suspected, or the games more supported tactic, run. You must run taking turns at high speeds trying to elude your pursuers. Once they cannot see you, you are then tasked with finding a good hiding place until they give up. You will find that sitting on a bench, blending in with scholars or hiding in a pile of hay can prove most useful in eluding your captors. If no pile of hay is available, take to the roofs and hide in one of the convenient covered gardens. In fact the best way to get away from the heat is the rooftops. All in all the whole system of blending in and sneaking around is highly enjoyable and leaves you feeling quite superior. Satisfaction is delivered on all fronts of this amazing title. Side notes to mention are the fact that though it is great to have in engine cut scenes, you also need a way to skip through them. They become annoying at best on a second play through of any particular chapter. Speaking of a second play through, there really isn't much of a need for it. There isn't much replay value unless you are just itching to find every single last flag in the game. The fact that you have to play the entire chapter over again and cannot just pick up in one spot doesn't help. You might as well just play the whole thing again from start to finish. The whole game won't take you an incredible amount of time to get through but it is a game worth playing if not owning just for its sheer mastery. Through the ingenious gameplay and attention to detail, UbiSoft has delivered to us an experience like non other. The drawbacks aside this is a game worth every penny and it gets a 9 out of 10 only because of the problems it has with the PS3 engine. A 9 out of 10 is ""Above and Beyond"" in my rating system and that is exactly what this game goes.(I use a 10 point scale so with Giant Bomb's 5 point system it equals out to a 4.5)]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[  Assassins Creed is an engaging game the first time you experience what it has to offer. Clearly the best part of the game is the movement of which Altaïr is able to complete, as he can leap and move in ways similar to the activity of 'Parkour'. The movement of Altair is fantastic, especially when watching him crookedly climb upwards to the top of a building or running   across  the roofs of houses to escape the guards of the city. This is undeniably the strongest part of Assassins Creed as it is thrilling to watch his realistic movement. Altaïrs use of the cities is also great, which reminds me of early Tomb Raider climbing in the search for specific ledges. Assassins Creed develops this style of movement but branches out further, and uses more of the buildings small architecture. This allows for a more realistic style of climbing.   The graphics in the game are generally great.  But there are small noticeable glitches throughout, which take away from the immersion.    Assassins Creed Is fantastic for the movement and graphics, but the game is brought down by technical issues and the plot. The end of the game is unsatisfying and left me wanting more from the story, which is   disappointing  as the start of the game nicely set up the base plot. Towards the end of the game I felt the story growing less engaging and more an 'add-on' the game. One of the main reasons for feeling not attached is the dull assassinations that are assigned to you throughout the game. After the second or third killing that you are forced to commit, you soon  realise  that this is all that the game has to offer. There is no different approach to the killings either, just attack from your own angle, and kill. That’s it.  The fighting system is simple and fun to watch, but it easily becomes repetitive.  The motions of these fights are good, but like many other parts of the game it becomes a strain and does not differ in movement or look.    Some of the AI in the game can be considered unfinished as there actions are questionable at points. In the time I spent playing this game, I successfully counted six enemy guards getting stuck in the walls and   that’s  not even considering the civilians in the game. Basically these small bugs withdraw from the games atmosphere and really take away from the games belief.  Putting the issues aside that Assassins Creed has, I still found parts of the game enjoyable. I feel that because of the hype and excitement that built up the game it was a   disappointment  that  Ubisoft  would not work on the things such as - improve the fighting mechanics or 'Iron out' the small glitches that all bring down the game.  After talking to other people about there views on this game, I decided that Assassins Creed is a game that either grabs you or   isn’t  that interesting at many points. I personally recommend that if you feel Assassins Creed looks impressive that you first rent out the game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed offers a unique blend of stunning graphic design, excellent voice acting and a very different, but complex storyline. There is an endless amount to do in the game that will leave you satisfied and hungry for more.   Assassin's Creed follows the tale of Altair, a highly skilled 12th Century assassin and his journey through the Holy Land, during the Crusades. You will encounter different environments in the cities you will visit: Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem. Each city is beautifully designed and rendered which will leave you speechless at how life like the cities are.  Each city is alive with a thriving populace and busy streets. In the cities you will encounter beggars, drunks, town guards and hardy Templar Knights; and of course the people going about their normal business. You must take into account the population when making your move on your target as the population can be your best friend or worst nightmare.  The visual quality of Assassin's Creed is one of its many strengths. Each city is enormous and is your's to explore--though most of the cities are cut down to districts which are unlocked as you progress through the story. Everything is beautifully textured from the ancient pottery to the exquisite rugs and detailed clothing on the citizens. Most walls can be scaled one way or another by Altair and you can jump gracefully from one building to another, and you can leap from high towers into bails of hay when the opportunity arises. This makes gives you an extremely fun alternative to running from the guards in the busy streets--why not take them to the roofs?  Moving around the roofs and in combat is easily mastered by the sleek controls also make the game very fun to play. It seems effortless to cut down guards and just running and climbing is extremely easy to master. Fighting the guards in close combat can be a tempting challenge but it becomes more difficult when you are being pursued by 10 or 15 guards who will encircle you and attack; fleeing from them and using your profound agility can help you fend off the guards, allowing you time to escape to the roofs where they will be no match for your speed.  Assassin's Creed's sound quality is one of the best to date for a game. Everything you will hear adds to the experience of being in a busy city. As you walk the streets, you will hear the cries of endangered citizens, their views on religion and politics, the pleas from desperate beggars and the ramblings of drunks all makes the citizens all the more interesting to interact with. The voice acting is also magnificent, each character is made their own thanks to the fantastic voice actors. Combined with this is a beautiful musical score. The subtle sounds of Middle-Eastern tones and harmonies brings the game to life and provides a unique blend of scores for the different situations that will arise.  The story is what binds the whole game together and makes it unique. The story is in two parts. One is centred around Desmond, descendant of Altair, who has been forcibly kidnapped by a researcher and is placed in a machine called and Animus, which withdraws Altair's memories from Desmond's mind. This is when you will begin to play as Altair, eliminating assassination targets sought by your Creed master. The story can be rather confusing at times and switching back to Desmond can some-what slow the pace of the game. The ending especially leaves you on a cliff hanger which opens doors for a possible sequel that will surely be on the table.  There are an endless amount of tasks to do in the game that will take you away from the main story for a short time. You have the opportunity to rescue citizens being bullied by the guards; you can climb tall towers to get a synchronized view of the cityscape and you can collect various flags which will eventually unlock some achievements. Each will grant you elusive benefits like vigilantes that will grab your pursuing enemies allowing you time to escape. Climbing ""View Points"" will also allow you a bird's eye view of the city and will reveal missions you must do to discover the location of your targets. These varied missions come in the form of eavesdropping on people's conversations, beating information out people and pick pocketing victims for more information on things like your target's position. All of this grants you opportunities to flex you stealth talents by creeping around gathering information on your prey and preparing your strike.  The game also gives you important choices to make: should you go in all knives blazing, or sneak in through the crowds of people and cunningly killing your foe with your hidden blade. You can use your throwing daggers to kill enemies from a distance or use your sword or short sword to kill them in close quarters. Each way has their own satisfying rewards, be it smooth gruesome combo kills or a sneaky knife in the back. Close combat can be risky business as killing innocent citizens will give you a severe loss of health which will hinder your confidence in a large fight.  Needless to say, stealth is your best option. You have the ability to sneak past guards by hiding among white-robed scholars or by blending into the crowd. However, knocking over crate and pot carriers will draw the guard's attention to you and or even drawing your weapon in public will make the guards draw their's in retaliation. This can lead to all sorts of problems whither it be trying to complete a mission or just getting from A to B. You may choose to stay and fight the guards off, but running to the roofs is a far more enjoyable experience as you can throw guards to their deaths from the rooftops or hide in the hay stacks or small gardens located there until the guards regroup and go back to their posts. It all adds to the game's immersive quality.  Assassin's Creed is one of those rare games that portrays how hard Montreal Studios has worked on this game. The graphics, especially in High-Definition are stunning and is the sound quality of the game. From the living and breathing cities, to the slick combat and free running qualities of the game, it provides a deeply satisfying experience that you will soon not forget.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ In Assassins Creed you play as Altair. You are part of a brotherhood of Assassins that are on a quest to protect the holy land from the invading crusaders. Assassins Creed is a game that will bring you along on a unique adventure unlike any other.  At this point if you have heard of Assassins Creed you know about the ""twist"". In reality you play Desmond who is a test monkey for some kind of evil cooperation. Extremely early in the game you find out that these mysterious scientists are holding you captive in order to get information on your ancestor, Altair. So therefore you must relive Altair's life in order to obtain the correct ""information"".  While playing you are thrust into one of three massive cities. Being as Assassin gives you the ability to scale buildings in a fashion that would put Spiderman to shame. Altair will fluidly scale massive towers grabbing rails and scaffolding without any hesitation. This is by far the best part of Assassins Creed; the platforming game play in this game completely elevate the genre and sets a new benchmark that will be tough be match and even harder to surpass.  While the cities themselves are a superb achievement the events going on within the city are rather disappointing. Whenever you go to a new part of the city you must follow a set routine. First you must get to a high point and survey the surrounding area. Secondly you must collect information on your target. In order to get this information you do one of four things. You can eavesdrop on chatty citizens to get the scoop. Pick pocketing an important document is another possible objective, or you can beat the information out of talkative individuals. While these three objectives make sense in terms of collecting information there is another type that make me confused. There are fellow assassins littered throughout the city that want you to complete objectives for them in exchange for information. However these objectives are so dumb; you either have to finish off their assassination duties for them, or collect the flags that they seem to misplace every single time you talk to them. This might not seem like much but I have one question, whats the point of collecting your stupid flags?  Regardless once you're done with those you have to go and assassinate your main target. These also seem to go by some sort of loose routine. You must find your target wade through the crowd of people and go in for the kill. Once everyone notices the corpse on the ground twenty guards show up to brawl. This brings me to my next topic of discussion, the combat. Early off in the game you spend most of the time mashing on the X button until dudes die. Eventually you will build up a repertoire of moves that will make you a very formidable opponent. However there is one move that seems a little overpowered, the counter attack just has you patiently guarding until someone on attacks you and you counter which gives you the one hit kill. Then you can just wait as each guard approaches you in an orderly fashion each eagerly awaiting their turn to review a good slash to the face.  While this is fun and exciting the first time around, you soon realize that this cycle will repeat a total of eleven times. Around the third time the cycle starts to become extremely tiresome. This is the major thing about Assassins Creed. Your tolerance to repeat this cycle will determine the amount of enjoyment that you will be able to get out of Assassins Creed. For most people I would recommend you borrow or rent this game first. Assassins Creed is not a game that is necessarily worth the sixty dollar price. In the end the amount of time you can stay immersed in the world will dictate how far you will go with this game. Whether or not you get to the end, everyone should at least experience this game. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assasin's Creed is a game with a great story, great locations, a good set of gameplay mechanincs and but a few minor annoyances.The game features two inter-linked story arcs: one set in the near future, and another nearly a thousand years a go. The main story (from an overall plot perspective, not the story most heavily featured) has your character Desmond captured by a scientific research organisation. There intentions are to use a device call 'the animus' to access your genetic memories (memories passed on from generation to generation through the gentic code) in order to find something. Entering in to these memories grants you control of Altaïr, an extremely agile 12th century assasin who caught in the holy land in the middle of the crusades. The majority of the game is then spent assasinating various targets for your master, Al Mualim, and learning of the connection that these men hold, bringing you closer to that which your modern day captors seek.For the most part, your main interaction comes from receieving targets from Al Mualim, leader of the Assasins Creed, and heading out to the city where they can be found. It is then your job to move about the city in order to gain an understanding of the surroundings and aquire information that will help you locate and kill your target. You do this by scalling tall towers, or 'view points', to spot where you can find information and then do a vaiety of tasks to get this information. These tasks include: eavsdropping on certain conversation, pick pocketing people for relevant maps and letters and helping other memers of the Creed in exchange for details they have already aquired. These tasks can prove to be fun, with individual dialogue accompanying each one - but the limited number of task types can feel repetitive towards the end of the game.Once you have learnt enough to locate the target your attentions then turn to the assasination. The target's location is added to your map, and can usually be found at some sort of public event. You watch a small in game scene, which helps flesh out your targets, before you can move in and kill them. Sometimes this will be a case of sneaking behind them to steathily take them down, and other times you will be spotted and have to chase the target down while the city guard attempt to stop you. After the assination you must escape to the local Assasins Bereau with the entire city on high alert, resulting in any time you are spotted you will be chased. Any time in the game that you are being chased you have to either fight and kill all of your pursuers or break their line of sight and then hide in a mound of hay, a roof garden or blend in with a group of scolars until the coast is clear.You repeat this formula for a number of targets, each one cryptically revealing more of the underlying plot. While the method is similar, each assasination has a unique situation and context to keep you interested on top of the ever developing story. The fighting in the game does a good job of enabling you to fend of multiple attackers, whose number genrally increases over the course of the game. Your main weapon here is your sword, while your hidden dagger, fists and to a lesser extenet your throwing knives/short sword are more suited to other situations. You can attack and block, and as you proceed though the game you learn to, amongst other thins, counter enemy attacks. The fighting is good, but later in the game I did feel that the game could allow you to be a little more aggressive, as you tend to rely mainly on counters to win battles. The free running is excellent, feeling smooth and fun to do. Climbing is well animated and manages to feel organic thanks to excellent level design, with movement only available is there is a ledge, crack or outcrop for Altaïr to grab on to. Sometimes, however, you may find that you cannot get Altaïr to move in the direction you want, despite having a route to move on, occasionally resulting in him leaping to his death instead of hopping across to the next hand hold. As mentioned at the start the scenery is breathtaking and each city is populated with thousands of citizens - creating an effective city atmosphere. There are three main huge cities to explore, with a large open 'world map' type area to cross on horseback to reach your destination. A nice feature is that later on you can skip the travelling between cities to help keep the story moving. The sound design is also strong with good set of voice acting, both in Desmond and Altaïr's world, and a suitable accompanying soundtrack which varies with location and level of tension/action.While some parts of this game may feel a bit repetitve, the visual design, the excellent game engine and a good, if not confusing, story to tie it together, more than make up for this. Even if the objectives get tiring, you can always run and leap across the rooftops or dive huge distances into a cart of hay because it is simply fun to do and watch. My only critisim of the game is that for all that it does well, it leaves you wishing that some of the repition  and other small annoyances had been dealt with to make a great game even better.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Ah what to say about Assassin's Creed well it is a beautiful experiance that will never be forgotten.But although in my top 5 games ever,it still has some bugs and it gets very repetitive to SOME but to me every kill was unforgettable.It is so satisfying to chop and break somebodys arm then slice there back.And all the boss assassination's are very fun to try and do it like a real assassin although I rarely could do that I just killed everybody but when you assassinate them it makes you go""Wow that freaking ruled!""And with the epic story it just gets better and better.The story sucks you in to the point where you are like what will happen next?And you keep thinking that for a while untill it ends but you are still thinking the same thing and I'm near 100% we'll get a answer.The graphics are superb and as of what I've seen there is no frame rate drops that I've saw.The controls are silky smooth....well not really because when you are jumping from building to building and so on and so on you will run into moments where you will miss what you are jumping on and it's just extremely frusterating.But my main hate in this game is the drunk hobo people that push you every time you walk by them and when you hit a guard although they should attack the drunks they attack you.Also sometimes I'll just be running and the guards will chase me.One thing people complained about was the realism,the realism is low because you can take on loads and loads of people at once.I said the controls were smooth but that doesn't work when I'm talking about riding the horse'es because you can run into a wall and get off and your horse just sits there making the noice that horse'es make and it is tough to get back on them and if you are being chased by some people in one of the small city's on the way to the bigger city's the horse can get stuck in little areas and your screwed.And also when you are going to the big city's at the begining you can't just skip to the place you have to ride a horse there and that is one of the most frusterating things to do in the game.Multiplayer:~~None~~Re-play Value:I usally bash games that have no multiplayer when it comes to replay value,but I honestly think 5 weeks after you beat Assassin's Creed you'll want to play it again.Not for the great story but to do those greatly satisfying assassinations.And killing people with swords is always fun.:)And maybe you didn't understand something in the story so you might want to re-play it again make a excuse.End It!:All in all this game is a buy.From the epic storyline to some amazing kills and I didn't mention this but it has some nice voice actors.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Ok assassins creed is one a game which will be remembered for a long time.Firsly the graphics are amazing, I think its the best graphical game to date, everything from Altair to the massive environment with leaves growing from trees tall buildings which dont lose texture and the many people populating the holy land not many of them copies of each other.The sound in assassins creed is excellent. great voice acting by all the characters, sword fights sound great and realistic, and one cool feature of the game is ramdom people say stuff when they see you running and climbling.Storyline wise is awsome. You actually play as two people, the game is actually set in the future and you are Desmond who is really an assassin 9he doesnt know it) and the main doctor who is experimentinng on him is a templer (the assassins arch rivels). Desmond can go back to his ancester memories which is where most of the game takes place.Gameplay of assassins creed is good. Basically you undergo a mission which turns out badly and you get stripped of your rank and all throughtout the game you are trying to restore it by doing other assassinations throught 3 cities in the holy land. Right the bit why people dont like this game is they say it is repetitive. well it is to some extend but you will want to play the game anyway to see how all the story pans out.The map is HUGE on assassins creed which provides awsome free roming experience where you can just kill guards for fun (which is one of the best features of the game).It doesnt really have any reply value but there is a ton of flags (420) to collect and templers to kill (60).Control wise is does it good job. you can easily climb any climbable surface at will just by holding down one button and the controls used for combat worked well too.Overall assassins creed is the best graphical game to date and it just proves how good next gen consoles are. I would recommand it to anyone. Seriously get this game!! ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[A spiritual sequel to the Prince of Persia games of the last generation of consoles, Creed has a familiar feel but replaces the linearity with an open world, wall running and time control powers with an awesome free-running system, the fantasy setting with a science fiction one, and the mediocre combat with slightly different mediocre combat. Many have complained about the repetitive mission structure, and they're justified in doing so. There are only about half a dozen types of activities you can do than make up the bulk of the game, leaving the actual assassinating a little too infrequent. But it's not that big of a deal. I wish they could have fleshed out the whole investigating idea, and made it feel more like you were planning a highly delicate operation instead of just repeating some simple tasks before getting to go after your target, but I can't blame them too much when it's so fun just to play around in the world. If you don't like picking pockets and doing all the other assassin's chores, you only have to do some of it. If something's frustrating, you usually can ignore it and still move on with the game. Personally, I did every investigation, rescued every citizen, and climbed every vantage point. The game rewards you for doing so, giving you tips and maps that make the job a little easier and extra means to escape pursuers. I didn't collect all the flags though, because that would be tiresome and completely pointless, as all they unlock is achievements in the 360 version.Other problems people have is with the AI and combat that's all too easy once you learn the counter-kill. I agree that it's pretty ridiculous that you can get away with killing guards right in front of each other if you just pose like a monk while doing it, but once they do start chasing you, I was pretty impressed with how they kept up. Getting away from guards is about as fun a chase as there is in video games. Altair can climb and jump and do anything a human could conceivably do, and it's a unique sort of fun to use your awesome yet believable abilities to evade soldiers who can chase you almost anywhere. It is pretty lame how enemies only attack one at a time, but while it's too easy, I did have fun toying with enemies before dispatching them in a number of satisfying ways. The open space between cities was also a bit of fun to ride around in on a horse, and definitely gave off a Shadow of the Colossus vibe with the look of the environment. It's not really a spoiler to say that this game doesn't take place during the crusades, since it's revealed you're in a simulation during the near future right at the beginning. There are two plot threads, the crusade one which wraps up by game's end, and the future one that does a good job of stringing you along with little bits of information before leaving you hanging for the obvious sequel. It will be interesting to see where they go with that, I imagine it will take place at a different point in history, with perhaps the third game finally being all in the modern day. The voice acting is a bit repetitive, but otherwise the game sounds good, and looks good too. The look is very nice, and technically the world is very impressive, except for some pop up when outdoors and an inconsistent frame rate. What's odd is that it doesn't slow down, but speed up in a couple unique situations. It's not a big deal, just strange. Assassin's Creed isn't the completely amazing game it looked like it could have been from the trailers, but they definitely built a very promising foundation for the future.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed. People have been raving about it ever since it was first announced. The first trailer implied that you would be able to kill anybody, and disappear into a random crowd as one of them. Showcasing some top notch AI, and amazing crowd gameplay mechaty on just who to trust. Is your leader really the man who should be leading? Or are the scum of the earth lying to you? The story in Assassin's Creed is really well told, at a pretty good pace.  Ubisoft Montreal decided to unload a big twist in the first five minutes of the game, but for those of you who don't know yet, we won't spoil anything for you. -SPOLIERS AHEAD- Just kidding.  The game kicks off with Altair not following the rules of the assassin's creed, so he is punished, and is stripped of all his rankings and equipment, and basically has to start of as a noob all over again. The assassin town of Masyaf, is attacked by Robert de Sable and his army. Afterwards, there are rumours of a traitor within the city, and without anything, Altair has to go and scope this guy out, and bring him to Al Mualim, the assassin leader. This is a tutorial mission, and shows you the basics of everything. nics, Assassin's Creed was prone to become one of gaming's best. Although, that's not particularly true, Assassin's Creed is still a refreshing, crisp, beautiful next gen experience, and is one of the best action games of 2007.   You play as Altair, a 12th century assassin. The holy land is being ravaged by war during the third crusade, and is being torn apart by corruption. As Altair, you are given a list of nine men, who really are a bad influence on the world, and you need to pick them all off one by one. That may sound totally shallow, but actually the story is very deep, as each man you kill just furthers your curiosi The controls in Creed are really inventive, as each face button is used to control Altair tediously. One button is used for looking around, and the two side face buttons are used to control Altair's hands. One controls his armed hand, and one controls his unarmed hand, which is used for gently pushing civilians out of the way. The bottom face button is used to control the speed of Altair's walking. When not holding down the right trigger, Altair is in low profile mode. This means that he'll walk at a normal pace, and not bump into anybody, and this is good for when you are trying to remain anonymous. When the right trigger is held down, Altair will start running, bump into people, but he will be the dangerous badass he's supposed to be. This is great when you are running from pursuers, attacking, or chasing down a target. There is a pretty good learning curve, but you should figure out how to kill pretty early in the game.  Each city in AC is huge, and full of life. Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem are where you'll be doing all of your assassination missions. Each mission starts off with you speaking to the assassin bureau leader of that city about your target, and he'll tell you everything he knows about your target. He'll tell you stuff on where you can find witnesses, and where he thinks the target should be. He'll then give you leave to go, and find out when and where to strike. Climbing all the tallest areas is the best way to start, as it points out where witnesses will be. The mini missions are necessary in completing the mission, and these include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, and intimidating witnesses so they'll spill some juicy info. Pickpocketing has you following a guy for a little while, and pickpocketing at the right moment when he isn't looking. Eavesdropping has you sitting on a bench and listening to some guys talk it out, while intimidating has you best the living hell out of a guy. None of the three are particularly game sellers, but they get the job done by setting the mood and realism of the situations.  After doing two or three of those tasks, you may return to the bureau and let the dude know you know when and where and who to strike. Among arrival at the target, you'll witness some events that highlight just how twisted they are, and let you know that they need to die. After the cutscene, there'll be a few ways to kill your target, and the fun is picking which one to take. Either running through the crowd, or going around the side, or leaping on him from above, the choice is yours.  After you do your biz, you'll need to run from anybody who opposes you. The best way is booking it to the roofs, and then hiding in a roof garden. However, if you choose to take the streets, and get caught, Altair can really hold his own. The combat system is by far the best part of Assassin's Creed. When you have all your abilities, you'll be able to dodge attacks, break grabs, and counter moves defensively. The animations are super slick during the fighting, and Altair looks like he's been trained by the choreographer for the Matrix. Instead of explaining, just take a look.  Graphically, Assassin's Creed is really, really, really hot. The cities look absolutely phenomenal, the water is good, the character models are great, and the animations in climbing, fighting, and just plain moving are some of the best ever. Unfortunately, the frame rate in Creed is really sub par. When running from rooftop to rooftop, sometimes it will drop into the single digits. This is a little frustrating, since you are trying to be quick and smooth, and here, your character on screen is warping across the city. This only lasts a few seconds, and luckily, the framerate is silky smooth during the fight sequences, which is the best part of the game. Climbing is also unplagued by this issue. It's a real shame, though, that such a pretty game is f**ked up by a stuttering framerate.  Assassin's Creed sounds just as great as it looks, with some great voice acting from the smallest parts. Each line is hit perfectly, and people will talk about their daily lives to each other, and will say things like ""What the hell is he doing?"" as you bump into people, and climb up walls. The instrumental score is mostly original, and has a unique tone to it. It's orchestral, as well as digital.  There's really nothing else to say about Assassin's Creed, other than it's a great game with a few nagging flaws keeping it from perfection. After beating the 12 hour game, you'll stay away from it for awhile, and then come back when you're in the mood for killing. It's ideas are fresh, and are pulled off pretty well. There is really nothing else like Creed, so really give it a buy. You won't regret it.]]>"
Assassin'creed,<![CDATA[SO let me just say i reviewd Assassins creed 3 times now and this is how i feel after playing the game alot.So when I was at the store To take the orange box back because it didn't work they didn't have any so they said just pick out another game and I saw assassins creed and i was like hell ya and the clerk said its amazing and i poped it in and my hardrive was screwed up so i sat there with out saving for about 7 hours and was on the 6th mission. so i finialy got something to save the game one and i quit frankly couldn't stand another play thorough.So the story of assassins creed has you play as to people Altier and his descendant and the descendant story has you being tested in a lab kinda like a rat and you are linked back in time through some table to your ancester who is a selfih assassins who ends up screwing up a mission and is de rainked and has to earn his rank back by assassinating these people. the people you assassinate in assassins creed were real but had dissapered the story is ok in assassins creed but the second story as the descendant is just plane stupid and just ruiens the whole experince for you.THe sound is assassins creed is realy good the voice acting is agood and has its moments but there is one thing wrong all the gard people and civilians have the same voice and when your doing something tell you to stop acting like a kid wich is kinda anyoing and often results in me stabing themthe grpachis in assassins creed is prety amazing its so beautiful the characters look amazing the city is stellar and everything around you is quite beautiful. there is some minior things there is some glitches in the game like walking of the edge and there is about 4 more feet of invisible platform wich is kinda dissapointing.the game play is what sucks the side story has you literly talking to some people and laying down on some table. NOw as the assassin altier you go on these missions and pick pocket ease drop and visit your local assassins bural to get info then you get to climb high points to lean the area alot better then you go and watch your target do something stupid and sneak around him and kill him and escape from the city on hore back.thats bassicly all mission in the game and it gets realy boring you can go horse back but its boring you can walk around killing gards and do prety cool looking combat moves in the game you can alos climb buldings and leap of them to others and hide in some hay and blend with some monks t oalert the gards away and its so repditvie it just takes away the whole expreince and its rather lame..so overall the value is terrible the gameplay is absolutly terrible and boring and ign called this game one of the top 5 dissapointments and i couldn't agree less its absolutly broking the sound 9the graphics 9the gameplay 3the value 1the story 5overall 4.0 ]]>
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When I was younger, I always wanted to be an assassin. For some reason, the thought of sneaking around in shadows and getting the drop on a drug lord always seemed to appeal to me. When I first heard about Assassin’s Creed, I immediately thought that my dreams were going to become a reality. With large sweeping cities to use as my playground, I imagined leaping from high buildings into a packed market while being chased by my pursuers. In a way, my dreams came true, but that doesn’t mean that everything was great from start to finish.The story in Assassin’s Creed focuses on taking down a group of men that are jointly working towards a much larger goal. With each assassination you learn a little more about the reasoning behind it all, but never is there a time where you think you absolutely have it all figured out. The story is represented to the player in memory blocks which are basically just that. Blocks of a memory being repeated back in order to solve the puzzle. Why are they memories? Well, I’m not going to give that away. Overall the story is presented in a very mature and cinematic way that will satisfy even the most judgemental gamers.The first thing you will notice about Assassin’s Creed is simply how beautiful it looks. If you’re playing it on an HD television set, you’ll be treated to high-definition in all its glory. Sadly, the game doesn’t really seem to stand up on a standard tube set as it’s going to be cutting off much of the HUD at the sides. Other than that, the graphics hook you from the very first time you climb a building in order to synchronize yourself with your surroundings. The character models and movement are pretty spot on, although you do tend to run into the odd glitches when dispatching adversaries. A great showcase if you have a home theatre you want to show off to all your friends.In terms of sound quality, voice acting is where Assassin’s Creed truly shines. From Altair’s sarcastic droll to the accents of all the nationalities, the team over a Ubisoft hit it right on. Not once did I cringe from uncomfortable scripting and with so many lines of dialogue I would consider that a huge accomplishment. The soundtrack suit’s the style of title and it never feels forced into areas of gameplay that it doesn’t belong. The only complaint I have about the sound is how annoying they made the homeless people, but that could be attributed to the fact that homeless people in fact are pretty annoying.Perhaps the biggest flaw in Assassin’s Creed is what I feel is one of the most important factors in any title. The lasting appeal of what you’re given to do in the game just doesn’t really hold anyone’s attention for too long. While the assassination investigations are great fun, you’ll quickly find yourself getting tired of completing all of the extra objectives they throw at you. In a city you have a handful of things to do and when you move onto a new part of a city, you get to do the same things all over again. A little repetitive, but definitely not needed to progress through the game. In other words, if you want to play through the story you can probably do it in a day, where as if you wanted to complete the game to 100% completion, you’ll be spending a lot more time doing the same thing over and over.Your mileage may vary when it comes to Assassin’s Creed. It’s an extremely polished and fun title for those that simply enjoy running around and completing the assassinations, but a letdown for those that are expecting a middle eastern GTA. If you go into Assassin’s Creed, play an hour or two every couple of days, you’ll have a better experience than those that try squeezing every little bit of the gameplay out of the game in an afternoon. I enjoyed it and even though I can’t recommend it as a buy for everyone, I do recommend that everyone give it a shot.Kim Fidler]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assasins creed is a well polished and great looking game.  But after a couple days of playing it, it got to the point of well i just keep doing the same stuff over and over again, and i didn't feel much need to go further. The gameplay is quite unique the first 4-6 hours and i was truly addicted but towards the end of the game, it doesn't freshen up.  Jumping on buildings and saving citizens can only be fresh, so many times.  After completing the main objectives you are then transported back to the beginning to see a cutscene of your next objective, you also get a new ability.  unfortunatly its the same stuff over and over again.if your interested in this game, i would just go out and rent it, as it only takes about 14 hours to beat.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When me and my dad sat down and played Assasins Creed for the first time we were in awe, [he still is]. And to cut it short the first half of the game is some of the best gameplay i have EVER layed my hands on. But then the second half sets in, the crappy AI bugs, the repetitiveness and the Boss kills SUCK, they say theres ""freedom"" but if theyre were anyother options to take out a target other than sneak halfway in and kill everything in sight with the overly powerful counter attacks PLZ TELL ME!. I thought that i wasted 60 dollars when i got this the day it came out and i couldnt be more disgusted with myself for not waiting for the reviews. LOVE IT, but HATE IT, if i had rented it i wouldnt be so upset with it, but overall do not buy it i have yet to play it since the second week i bought it, [but my dad still collects flags] LAWL]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[If you have been following any of my other game reviews then you should already know that I haven't gave a game a 10 out of 10 before…..some were really close to it but now…..well….this game has a story….and it must be told to everyone…..Ill start off with which I want to say…..this game is just unique it dosent take anything from any other game and totally recreates the way games should be made. The free roam experience and the ability to actually KILL anyone you want is just unbelievable I love history and that's why I found this game so much fun.I was a total fan of the movie Kingdom of Heaven so when I heard that they would be coming out with something that actually has to do with Jerusalem I was In shock and wondered how this game would even look and play like so now ill really begin.Ill gets to the story first, if you have seen different movies about medieval times and about King Arthur or anything like that and have an Xbox 360 you will probably love this game just because it has to do with Jerusalem, the game takes place during the Third Crusade, in the year 1191. The player assumes the role of Altair, (""The Flying One"") and your basic objective is to kill all nine historical characters who are propagating the Crusades sounds cool doesn't it?When the game begins, Christian King, Richard the Lionheart, has just recaptured the port city of Acre from occupying Muslims. With a base of operations established, the Crusaders prepare to march south. Their true target is Jerusalem – which they intend to recapture for Christianity. However, Saladin, leader of the Islamic army, currently rules the city. Stinging from his army's defeat at Acre, he will not allow Richard to humiliate him again. The Muslim forces are massing in the ruins of Arsuf, intending to ambush the Crusaders and prevent them from reaching Jerusalem but I wont give any more details sorry if I spoiled anything ^^""There is also some sort of sci-fi story that goes along with the plot as well but I wont give out any spoilers but something does happen with the future as well, so now a lot of older people will like it so they can find out about the historical cause which is actually great since games now are getting the sense that people like great stories back like 1000 years ago.Now when it comes to the game play…there were some worries about it but I am here to tell you….dont listen to them the game play is actually really smooth and fits in with our flying bird character, ill get to the controls after but you basically have four types of weapon's Throwing knives, A Short Sword, A hidden Blade and although I haven't seen the crossbow yet im pretty sure it's a weapon since its always on my back lolYou will also notice that it has similar game play to The Prince of Persia, well you are a master assassin and also PoP was made by Ubisoft as well so it does take the element of climbing up walls and running around and everything. This game also has the free roam feature which is incredible!!! You just look so cool walking around the streets of Jerusalem and then all of a sudden a beggar comes up to you and asks for some money. Be Nice? NAH I freaking stabbed her and ran away,There is a alarm system so if you kill someone you have to hide for a certain amount of time until it goes blue then you have to conceal yourself in the streets and blend in until your alright…..or you can just stay out and continue to kill people and guards ^^.People will always and usually get in your way but you can actually just push them out of the way or throw them down to the ground and continue going along or if one of them follows you….you can always kill them….just a suggestion lolNow with the controls this was the biggest thing people were worried about, the controls are a bit odd all the buttons are apart of Altair body B is right arm, X is left arm, Y is your head and A are your feat. Long time gamers won't have much trouble and should be able to get a grasp of it quite quickly but newcomers will probably have troubles at first but my friend was playing it and he doesn't really play games and he DIED like 5 times until he started to jump around…..and kill people…..then continue to kill people.So if you aren't a big gamer but you want this game just be careful you won't get the controls at the start but if you continue to play you will be able to play better and continue to be better.Now the graphics are outstanding to me!! All the characters look really real and a lot of them have different emotes which is also a nice feature. When you get on top of the roof of a building and look around you might actually stay there for a while just to look at the scenery.Overall This game is an outstanding in Visual, Game play, and story, the controls are a bit shaky but you will get over them and enjoy yourself as you run around the streets of Jerusalem and continue to assassinate 9 historical figures of the time…..or you can assassinate anyone….REMEMBER JUST A SUGGESTION lol have fun guys!!!]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Going into the game I wasn't really expecting much.  Sure there are people like KTVO who say it's the greatest thing  since sliced bread, but it has also been refered to as the unflattering yet comical ""ass creed"", so I wasn't sure who to believe.  The first thing that stood out to me when I started would have to be the environment.  The way people are dressed, the dialogue, and the buildings are all very well done, and you really feel immersed in the time period.  The biggest problem with the game would be the repetitiveness of the missions.  Before you get to assassinate your target you have to do the same things over, and over, and over again.  The game's story is interesting so it'll keep you motivated to keep going. The ending, however, is total crap.  There is absolutly no closure and leaves you wanting to know what ultimately happens to the protagonist.   Pros:  Sweet environment, great open world game play, intriguing story, kristin bell!Cons: Repetitious, horrid ending, combat isn't great. This game kicks ice!  It's only 30 bucks now so it's worth buying.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The rumors are true. Assassins Creed does indeed get a bit repetitive in its core gameplay mechanics. Before each of the nine major assassinations that Altair is required to perform you must:1) Climb to several high points in the city, and hit a button that forces you to look around at the beautiful     environment.2) Sneak about the alleyways, or climb to the rooftops and run with amazingly fluid animation.3) Eavesdrop on others who often give you helpful and important information about your current target.4) Kill a bunch of fools with cinematic finishing moves that makes everyone else in the game run for cover.Or you can skip almost all of that and get right to the main event. And oh, what events they are. Corrupt officials, psychotic military leaders, evil doctors, conspirators all, but for who? And what? What could tie these men together?I was sucked in by the story, loved the main assassinations, and happily played through the repetitive investigations side missions just because I loved the immersive world Altair lived in so much. There was nothing better than sneaking down a wall like Spider-Assassin, carefully stepping up behind the target, delivering the killing blow with the hidden blade, getting even more juicy story elements from the target himself, and then running like hell, the whole city alert and on your tail. The game itself could certainly have had more variety, but the story and game engine technology more than made up for it in my book. Climb to top of the cathedral in Acre, perch on the cross at the top like the bird of prey you are, and simply enjoy the view. It's really stunning.The new Prince of Persia game is apparently built off the same game engine as this. I cannot wait.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I found the game to be good, but not great. I’ll start off with all the negatives, so as to get them out of the way: repetitive gameplay, a shit-load of bugs, and a not too satisfying narrative (very minor spoilers).Although AC claims to let you explore each city and the lands surrounding them at your leisure, there’s not much to actually explore. The game limits you to the outdoors, with only a handful of indoor locations. Aside from the actual storyline, there is not much else to do except collect some pointless little flags/banners, which isn’t even worth the effort. Each city looks practically the same, with only a change in the theme. The missions Altair is sent on are also identical. It all leads down to either eavesdropping, pick-pocketing, or interrogating, as well as scanning an area to add it to your map. Although great at first, these missions start to get tedious after the third of fourth time.The boring nature of these missions isn’t helped by the fact that the player (specifically the PlayStation player) constantly encounters a number of bugs which range from flying, to your horse breaking it’s legs, to all people climbing the roofs, to time stopping (as you can see in my latest user movie). It can really piss someone off if they constantly have to restart their system to play the game. However, luckily the game saves like every five minutes, meaning you can restart without worrying about losing data.Moving onto the story: It’s not that the story is bad, but so much information was leaked during the development process that the “big surprise” that was expected wasn’t much of a surprise at all. I haven’t finished the game, so I can’t even spoil the ending for you if I wanted to; however, I hear the ending is highly unsatisfying. In my opinion, the story could have been crafted better, but with a whole franchise in front of it, it might evolve into something very epic.Despite the above mentioned minuses, I found the game perplexing. The whole “medieval Spider-Man” climbing mechanic is very exhilarating. Running away from guards is good fun and the “leaps of faith” never get old (though I’m still not convinced a pile of hay would stop all your bones from breaking). The fighting system is done exceptionally well also, but it gets too easy once you get the counter-attack move. Also, the game offers many ways to tackle a situation which is really cool. The only problem with this is that I usually found myself doing things against the current because it would have been to easy otherwise (for example, you can basically go anywhere by disguising oneself as a scholar; where’s the fun in that?).Verdict:Assassin’s Creed introduces a variety of new gameplay mechanics that are well designed and fun to play with; however, the mass of glitches and repetitive gameplay holds it back from its full potential. If the developers listen and fix these problems, future releases in the franchise may redefine gaming. Also, with the Animus, other settings, such as World War II or the 1700s, are not out of the question. So all in all I would say a solid 3.5 or rent]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed is game from Ubisoft Montreal, which seems to blend together elements from Thief, Hitman and free roaming titles such as Grand theft Auto. It then sticks you in a timeline during the crusades and gives you some incredible gymnastic abilities and allows you to run, jump and stab your way around the holy land with the aim of assassinating a list of targets given to you by your master. You play as Altair, a master assassin who, at the beginning of the game beaks some important tenets by killing an innocent man, and generally screwing the pooch when trying to retrieve some treasure. This leaves you with a problem, as when you return to the Brotherhood, a small village where all your assassin buddies chill out, you are in big trouble, and this costs you all your ranks and a lot of your equipment. In order to reclaim your title you must then undergo a challenge from your master, who basically tells you to murder nine targets and these are your missions for the rest of the game. However there is another story at play here. Everything that takes place while you control Altair is all just a memory that you are forced to re-enact by some scientists who have kidnapped your real character, a bar-tender named Desmond. I know, it all sounds a bit stupid but as the game progresses so does the story and it does actually become quite engaging, the most fun however is to be had while holding the reigns of your highly skilled assassin. The assassinations all play out in pretty much the same way, you go to one of the games three cities, Acre, Jerusalem or Damascus and head to the assassins bureau in that area. That is where you are told the areas to start investigating, and is ultimately where you go to start and finish your current missions. Before each assassination can be performed however, you need to complete three out of six investigations, these range from pick pocketing, eavesdropping, informer escorts and more. The PC version also got 2 extra investigations although some of these can feel a bit scripted at times and the game’s real strength is how the world around you is so unscripted. Ubisoft have done a fantastic job with creating this living, breathing world around you, the three cities themselves are huge, however they are also incredibly dense and this provides an enormous amount of possibilities. Around the cities you will find yourself pushing your way through crowds of civilians, losing the attention of pushy beggars and avoiding the troubles of rowdy drunks. Of course, killing civilians is deeply frowned upon and doing so too much will effectively “de-synchronise” you from the system and load your latest checkpoint. I often found myself struggling to keep to this rule as beggars pushed me and pleaded with me for some money. As you roam the city streets you will also come across civilians in need, being pushed around and bullied by guards, it is then up to you as to whether you should save them or not, if you do however, you will be given a reward either in the form of vigilantes, who will grab any guards chasing you through that area, or scholars, who will let you blend with them and allow you to bypass guard posts and other hotspots for enemy activity, as sort of a moving hiding spot. The combat in the game is also fairly satisfying, although the PC control scheme can sometimes bog you down with too many combinations, the game does however support controllers so if you have one, I would assume that would provide a more streamlined experience. The best thing about the sword combat is the counter finishing moves. These are basically “fatalities” in that they will finish off your target in the most gruesome, and awesome ways. The satisfaction of carrying out a combination of these cannot be described, and will literally have you laughing out loud in places as you brutally dispatch a whole group of guards in a few quick swings of your blade. Of course, you aren’t only limited to a sword, you have a hidden blade that you can use to stealthily take down someone in a crowd, or run and jump someone from behind to leap on their back and shove it through the back of the necks. You are also given throwing knives which provide a one hit kill and are useful for dispatching enemy bowmen on roof tops. By far the game’s main game play feature though is the free running. As mentioned before you have some pretty insane gymnastic abilities and you can simply climb all over anything as long as there is something to hold on to. This is also important as you often find yourself running from guards and in order to lose them you must first break the line of sight and then vanish into a hiding spot, such as a pile of hay, or a roof garden. You will usually end up jumping from rooftop to rooftop in these chases and they can get really exciting, however later in the game it can simply become a nuisance as the guards will get too suspicious for you to really do anything other than walk really slowly, and as soon as you do make an “anti-social” move, such as jogging, you will often find yourself with guards wanting to slice you limb from limb. This free running aspect easily becomes the game’s biggest downfall. It relies too much on this aspect of game play and it just becomes repetitive to the point where all you want to do is either put the game down, or just stop and kill everyone chasing you, which can take a while and can lead to your death. If only there were something to break up this sequence of events that repeat themselves over and over, the game would become much more replay-able. As it is though, I don’t think I will find myself going back to it for quite a while now that I have completed it and this took me a little over fourteen hours. Of course, it helps that the game is supported by some pretty impressive tech. I’m running the game on a machine that is a year and a half old, granted, I have an 8800GTS 320MB stuck in it, but if you have anything along these lines the game will run and look brilliant. The fact that the cities are so huge demands quite a lot of the engine and as you climb up to high viewpoints it amazingly retains a steady frame rate (and this is at 1680x1050 with all settings to max). It runs so much better than I had expected and it also looks amazing. The entire free-running aspect of the game depends on building geometry as Altair will only climb up walls if there are things to grab on to, therefore all the buildings and structures have so much detail in them and the textures looks great, especially with the HDR lighting. What looks great also sounds great, I sometimes came across a few sound glitches where it would skip and jump and sword contact sounds often messed up a little, but as you move around the cities, all of which are fairly unique, you can really appreciate the bustling sounds of the crowds chatting, speakers shouting out, and the wind blowing down the streets. The game’s visuals and sounds are nothing short of impressive. To sum it up, Assassin’s Creed is a great game, it provides us with something new and exciting and I really enjoyed it, however the formula gets pretty dull, pretty quickly and unless Ubisoft manages to break things up a little for the next one, I don’t really see it going too far. I would go as far as to suggest that you either play this at a friend’s house, or rent it first to see what you think as maybe just playing the first few hours of the game will give you everything you need.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[From the team that brought you Jade Raymond comes this epic third-person action/adventure game. Assassin’s Creed is a game with a lot of hype behind it, for a good reason. At first glance, it’s obviously a very visually impressive game that oozes of production value and artistic quality. It’s simply a delight to watch the main character, Altair, run around in the Middle-Eastern cities, cutting up templar knights. But visuals aside, there’s of course some gameplay involved. The acrobatic / sword-dueling gameplay is not that far away from the team’s earlier Prince of Persia games, but to me Assassin’s Creed has a bit more appeal than the old prince’s adventures. This is not only due to its art direction and tone, but also because of the game’s storytelling and mission structure. Most people who followed this game will remember that a certain “twist” overwhelmed the media buzz around this game. While I will not reveal the twist in itself (even though the game’s been out for quite a while at this point), I will say so much that it opens up for sequels that don’t necessarily take place in the setting of this first game. This is probably a deliberate choice of the studio/publisher for that exact reason, but it does serve other purposes as well. It gives Assassin’s Creed a unique attribute that really stands out. Assassin’s Creed is an enjoyable game with very simple but fun game mechanics. Altair is a wonderful character to control, and his ninja-like agility and abilities would put most videogame ninjas to shame. The downside, however, is that the game is very repetitive. With a long list of main targets and a number of side missions at your disposal, it doesn’t take long until you start to grow tired of the routines you’ll have to go through to finish a “level”. But players who’re willing to push through the somewhat weak middle part of the game are sure to be rewarded by an excellent finish that only leaves you hungry for more. Assassin’s Creed is far from a perfect game. It’s main downsides are by far the repetition and some quirky AI problems, but it still managed to keep me hooked the whole way with its engaging story and high fun factor. It’s going to be very interesting to see what waits in the next chapter.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed gives gamers the opportunity to explore a vast wilderness of characters through various cities in a quest across the “ Holy Land ” in the 12 th Century. Each of the cities you explore features unique characters that can be interacted with and ultimately assassinated. You play as Altair, an elite assassin chosen to reduce the powers of the Saracens and the Crusaders in the 12 th Century. Part of a creed you soon learn that a plot is unravelling that threatens the Holy Land .  Not only are the characters unique in this game but each city has a vast variety of buildings which Altair can ascend up, gaining viewpoints to give greater insight into the city itself and allowing Altair to discover missions in different areas of the city. The beauty of this game is that you have the freedom to wander the streets, passing through crowds of people, and save innocent victims from town guards hounding them. Assassin's Creed has no limitations, go where you want to go, do what you want to doMost gamers will recognise the similarities with the Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed. Although this title has nothing to do with the POP series it does lend itself to some of its gameplay styles. The difference with Assassin's Creed is that gamers are given much more control over the character. Movements and actions are not limited but are much more versatile to the environments you are found in. On commencement of Altair's campaign he can be quite difficult to manoeuvre around the environments. But to assist with this, the game has tutorials to help you move Altair around and perform combat effectively. You can always practise different combat moves in the training arena and perfect them for serious combat against guards later on in the cities you visit. The audio enhancements featured in Assassin's Creed are also nothing short of beautiful. The sound effects throughout the missions are very sharp and pleasant to the ear, the faint twittering of birds and draft of the wind can be heard from the rooftops. There is carefully placed music at particular intervals that capture the period of time the story is set in this all adds to placing you directly in the game making it such a thrilling gaming experience. Aside from the sound effects and music, the voice casting is also very good and like the POP series adds great depth to characters. Overall, Assassin's Creed is an immense action adventure that will take hours of your attention with its beautiful scenery and captivating story line. This game has set new records in its genre. Assassin's Creed is an essential pruchase for all POP fans and for people who are fond of the sand box genre.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I was so hyped up for this game before its release. I remember watching videos of it and... jade... yeah... The game looked so sweet! But then i get my hands on it and i'm not happy! Why am i not happy? Well... this game didn't live up to the hype.  The first 30 minutes of the game are pretty sweet, but then everything starts to get really repetitive. Having to do the same old go kill this guy, go get a feather from this guy, and sitting on a bench to listen in on someone over and over again gets really old!   Even the combat gets old! At first you might find it challenging and fun, but later on when you figure it out it's really lame. You can take out 20 guards at once no problem just by countering their attacks. Hell, i can take out 50 guards by countering over and over again.  Assassins are known to use stealth tactics to reach their target. Some tactics you can use in the game are cool, some are just dumb. A dumb one would be to hold both your hands together and act as a priest by holding a button... if you do that guards will not suspect of you. It's amazing the guards don't see all the weapons on me. What's cool is that you can climb all the buildings in the game to get a birds eye view of your targets and also to stay out of sight.  The cities in the game are huge and all look amazing. Go to the top of any building and just look around, the graphics are just insane. Not only do you have a huge city where you can go anywhere, but it's full of people as well. All this with very little slow downs if any. The textures, the character models all look top notch. AC is one of the best if not the best looking game of 2007.  AC won't have you playing for a long time. An average gamer can probably finish the main story is just 10 hours. There are also side missions to do like finding flags and killing all the templars.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I watched previews of this game amazed as to the stunning graphics and the super cool looking character. I bought the game the day it came out and I think this game might be a little better to watch then to play. I love the gameplay, it's without a doubt very inventive. But the story line is really quirky and the whole twist to the game is given out within 5 minutes of playing. Without a doubt this is an enjoyable game. The bad thing about it is the length at which you can enjoy it. The game has absolutely no replay value in sight which is why i gave it 3 and a half stars, out of 5.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Let me first say I realize some people love this game. I'm not one of them. I'd certainly like to be one of them, but it ultimately depends on what you personally think is ""fun"".Is ""fun"" gazing at lushly drawn and animated medieval figures in jammed cities with roughly the same amount of personality as a Ken & Barbie playset? Then you will have fun here. Is your idea of ""fun"" being railroaded from one mini-game objective to another with absolutely no chance to veer off-course? Then you, too, may find some fun here. Or perhaps your idea of ""fun"" is participating in clunky combat, button mashing with bad controller feedback, trying to follow a convoluted, boring plotline developed by entirely bland NPCs devoid of personality. Then perhaps Assassin's Creed is your game. I get no pleasure out of hating well-received games, but I really can't pinpoint what it is about this game that makes it so popular.Obviously, there's the graphics. It's a beautiful console game with a fresh artistic direction. Looks alone, Assassin's Creed can easily transport your eyeballs to another era. The animation is also incredilby well executed.But the beauty is so plainly skin-deep. You play in these large Medieval cities but interact with hardly anyone except specific targets for the varied mini-games (Eavesdropping, Pickpocketing, Defend Citizen). You see hundreds of people pass you by, but they are nothing but human salad dressing -- robotic garnish devoid of humanity or speech, designedly solely to make cities look full of ""life"" and mask how completely empty and soulless they actually are.I think I've realized what really is the most fun about Assassin's Creed, and that is the architecture. Climbing over it, looking at it, running over it, jumping over it, escaping from guards, running down alleyways, making daring rooftop leaps across markets below ... these are the moments when Assassin's Creed stops feeling like some developer's cool design document and actually achieves some adrenaline and whimsy and fun and interactivity. And how sad is that, for a game so lavishly praised and wonderfully marketed, all it really amounts to is jumping around a bunch of pretty buildings.Well, at least I can trade this game away, hopefully to someone who can enjoy it more than I did.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ In Assassins Creed you play as Altair. You are part of a brotherhood of Assassins that are on a quest to protect the holy land from the invading crusaders. Assassins Creed is a game that will bring you along on a unique adventure unlike any other. At this point if you have heard of Assassins Creed you know about the ""twist"". In reality you play Desmond who is a test monkey for some kind of evil cooperation. Extremely early in the game you find out that these mysterious scientists are holding you captive in order to get information on your ancestor, Altair. So therefore you must relive Altair's life in order to obtain the correct ""information"". While playing you are thrust into one of three massive cities. Being as Assassin gives you the ability to scale buildings in a fashion that would put Spiderman to shame. Altair will fluidly scale massive towers grabbing rails and scaffolding without any hesitation. This is by far the best part of Assassins Creed; the platforming game play in this game completely elevate the genre and sets a new benchmark that will be tough be match and even harder to surpass. While the cities themselves are a superb achievement the events going on within the city are rather disappointing. Whenever you go to a new part of the city you must follow a set routine. First you must get to a high point and survey the surrounding area. Secondly you must collect information on your target. In order to get this information you do one of four things. You can eavesdrop on chatty citizens to get the scoop. Pick pocketing an important document is another possible objective, or you can beat the information out of talkative individuals. While these three objectives make sense in terms of collecting information there is another type that make me confused. There are fellow assassins littered throughout the city that want you to complete objectives for them in exchange for information. However these objectives are so dumb; you either have to finish off their assassination duties for them, or collect the flags that they seem to misplace every single time you talk to them. This might not seem like much but I have one question, whats the point of collecting your stupid flags? Regardless once you're done with those you have to go and assassinate your main target. These also seem to go by some sort of loose routine. You must find your target wade through the crowd of people and go in for the kill. Once everyone notices the corpse on the ground twenty guards show up to brawl. This brings me to my next topic of discussion, the combat. Early off in the game you spend most of the time mashing on the X button until dudes die. Eventually you will build up a repertoire of moves that will make you a very formidable opponent. However there is one move that seems a little overpowered, the counter attack just has you patiently guarding until someone on attacks you and you counter which gives you the one hit kill. Then you can just wait as each guard approaches you in an orderly fashion each eagerly awaiting their turn to review a good slash to the face. While this is fun and exciting the first time around, you soon realize that this cycle will repeat a total of eleven times. Around the third time the cycle starts to become extremely tiresome. This is the major thing about Assassins Creed. Your tolerance to repeat this cycle will determine the amount of enjoyment that you will be able to get out of Assassins Creed. For most people I would recommend you borrow or rent this game first. Assassins Creed is not a game that is necessarily worth the sixty dollar price. In the end the amount of time you can stay immersed in the world will dictate how far you will go with this game. Whether or not you get to the end, everyone should at least experience this game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[First off Assassin's Creed is one of the greatest games of all time. It is extremely fun and easily accessible for new players but is also fun for long time players and any fan of prince of persia or similar games can enjoy this game. This game raises the bar for for what the new consoles can do. The story is just as amazing as the gameplay because the story is well written and the voice actors except maybe the voice actor playing Altier because he does not sound like an arab voice or something like that. In Assassin's Creed, two different story lines tie everything together. In the modern world a normal bartender named Desmond Miles who gets kidnapped by some medicine company. You find out that our DNA houses the memories of our ancestors. In the case of Desmond his ancestor that warren and lucy, two of the scientists studying Desmond, are studying Altier a master Assassin who gets stripped of his rank at the beggining of the game and has to work to get back to the top. Sort of like metroid at the beggining you have all your stuff and then later you eventually have nothing. This game also features parkour which is a french sport where you have to jump from building to building and other crazy stuff like that and it is really easy but its also really fun. One of the craziest things i did is jump from one building to another but the buildings where 10 yards apart.The combat in Assassin's Creed is really fun to do. At first it's just simple button mashing but when you get your rank up you will get the ability to counter. Countering is very important because its one hit kill and you have to really rely on your counter ability when facing a bunch of enemies at once. Although fighting is fun it's probably not the best way to take out your target. This game is mainly about being stealthy and one way to kill your target in a stealthy way is to use the hidden blade. The hidden blade is very easy to use just equip the blade, sneak up on a person and strike. Or, if you're feeling very bad you can push people off of tall buildings which is always satisfying. The game also brings in an idea called ""social stealth"" which is blending in with the crowd to become undetected. This is one the greatest technical things about the game is either running around and climbing buildings or you can walk and try to remain a normal person in the crowd.In the game you will be given nine people to assassinate but if you are only given nine people you have to just go kill them and then you're done in two minutes right. Wrong you have to first find out information on your target. Find out where they will be and when and also find out what kind of thing is your target doing that makes him such a bad person. You find out information by pick pocketing people, eavesdropping, interrogation, and by doing work for fellow assassins. All of these are very fun and a great way to use the abilities that the assassins have. This game will be a great franchise and hopefully the next game will further the story.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a game with a lot of misdirected and unused potential. Some will love it, others with loathe it but regardless of stance, there is a solid game buried in there.Assassin's Creed is one of those games that gets a lot of buzz, but ends up delivering a mixed package. It is by far one of the most visually impressive games out there, and is one of a select few games that manages to make sprawling urban environments that work (to a degree). Sadly, the game just push its own limits. It feels like a game that is trying hard to do more, but won't let itself. So, without further ado, let's step into the shoes of top assassin Altaï- er wait, Desmond Miles.It is hard to bash this game because of its plot, but I've got to. Assassin's Creed has gone with the majority of the entertainment industry and decided to weave together a conspiratorial plot involving the ever-mysterious Knights Templar. As such, anyone who's read The Da Vinci Code or caught any of the many trends that has spawned won't be entirely surprised or blown away from Assassin's Creed's plot, which is unfortunate, because a game like this is just starving for a compelling and fresh plot. I'm not saying the plot is terrible, but it isn't shocking, surprising or particularly new. I've talked to plenty of people who think the exact opposite and love it, so like many parts of the game, the plot itself is a bone of contention. Without giving too much away, you play as Desmond Miles in the year 2012 who's playing as an ancestor of his, Altaïr. Yes, to put it simply, you're playing a video game of a guy playing a video game. No matter how much narrative and drama you try to layer over that, the simple fact remains that it is a game within a game.But enough whining about story-telling, we're in this for the action. Altaïr's movements are all very fluid, and the acrobatic stunts you can perform are all fairly impressive. Combat is simple and intuitive once you get used to the 360-to-PC control set up, which does work, but takes some getting used to. You're probably just better off hooking up a 360 controller and playing it that way. All of the assassination animations feel skillfully executed and professional, but do suffer from one of the biggest flaws on this package: repetitiveness. I had a few gripes with the tutorial of all things, because at one point I was stuck doing one scene over and over again because one command wasn't working as it should've been, but that sorted itself out fairly quickly. All in all, controls will be the least of your issues that may come up with the game, they work, they're good, be happy.And here's the point where I start talking about the flow of assassinations (read: the missions, not the actual executions) themselves. To me, this is both the best, and the worst part about the game. This is the core gameplay, if anything this should be the best part of the game, but sadly this is what is dragging things down. All assassinations begin more or less the same way. Your boss gives you your orders, you go out to the city (and to the proper district, if necessary), check in with the local assassins, and then go out to collect intelligence on your target. Now, you collect intelligence by completing small missions within that district, as well as having two optional ones that are more for completionists. That doesn't sound bad, does it? Well, the problem is the missions are decided from a very small pool. You'll be pretty much doing the same missions in each city, the PC exclusive added missions are also heavily repeated, so while it does add a little more variety, you'll be seeing them all multiple times. Once you've gotten enough/all the intel on your target, you go back to the local hub and proceed to your target. Once again we stumble into a problem. To actually get to your target and perform a sneaky, y'know, assassination tends to be a chore. You are almost invariably spotted by your target or his entourage well before you get within dagger range, prompting a sword fight- sometimes with dozens of foes. Now that fight isn't hard, no, rather it just defeats the purpose of being an assassin. You end up felling more like a thug in the end when you go after your target and more like an assassin just wandering around the city.And while we're on the subject of cities, let's start talking environment. As I have said, Assassin's Creed is gorgeous; it is one of the best looking games of recent times. Monkeying around on the Dome of the Rock has never looked so good. And, seeing as how this game takes place in the Holy Land in the middle of Crusades, there's a ton of life in every city (and even the roadways and small towns have a little bit of action). I was blown away at first with the cities, the sheer activity was impressive but all was not right in Jerusalem. Not only is Altaïr the most obvious assassin out there (he walks into the city essentially wearing a sign I KILL PEOPLE), but everyone singles you out. All the time. Beggars standing on the streets, well, the second they catch a glimpse of you, they're in your face (curiously, they won't bother anybody else- apparently assassin garb screams rich in 1191) and if you get fed up and stab them, everyone freaks out, the guards come after you and you lose health. Woo. If only that was the worst part of being the Player Character in a sea of NPCs. No, the worst is the crazed/deranged citizens. You'll start encountering these guys after a couple of missions and it is their sole purpose to make you want to kill each and every one of them with a cruel and burning passion. See, what these guys do is wander around in a spot, usually a crowded one or an otherwise good alleyway for escapes and twitch and mutter to themselves. ""What's so bad about that?"" you say. Well, as soon as you get too close, they being their homing sequence and then proceed to shove you.OverAndOverAndOverAgain. This also, would only be a nuisance if it wasn't for the fact that if you then proceed to bump into anyone else, the guards flip out and attack you. This is an all-too-common occurance that also begs the question ""why only me?"" these guys mutter, twitch and generally spaz without attacking anyone else, but they seem to have a burning passion directed against you. With a little more development time and toying with AI, both the beggars and crazed guys would seem less like they're out to get you and more like the various facets of city-life. I have failed to touch on the guards themselves, which seem to understand that you're probably not the friendliest guy out there, and because of that, merely running around the town can sometimes cause a massive guard chase, but that isn't a common occurance. No, the annoying one is when you're traveling to other cities on horseback- during these sequences, if you don't have your horse trotting to your desired location, you're up to something, which will summon hordes of psychic guards upon you and alerting everyone across the land of your presense. So much for immersive, eh? Apparently in 1191, moving at more than a crawl on horseback was a treasonous act that would result in immediate attack. By everyone.But how does the game sound? Well, everything is spot on that is just creating a mood- music, idle chatter, and weapons all sound alright, but my one gripe with the sound direction is that the citizens you interact with (the generic ones that is- ones you are optionally tasked to ""save"") have about 10 lines total, so by the 3rd or 4th one you help out, you'll be hearing all too familiar lines. That's more nitpicking, and I'll let it slide, but it wouldn't hurt by any means to just try to do away with all this repetition plaguing Assassin's Creed.Assassin's Creed is solid. I know it sounds like all I've been doing is tearing it apart, but I did have an alright time with the game when its quirks and such weren't driving me up a wall. Sneaking around (or running, as the case usually is) on the rooftops, hunting down guards to more quickly and efficiently make it to objectives is fun, if only to watch your assassinations but the completionist inside of me is crying for something new or different between all these same objectives. If running around shanking people in the Holy Land during the Crusades appeals to you, you'll probably enjoy Assassin's Creed. If you're looking for an immersive, story driven, action-packed adventure, I'd take recommendations with a grain of salt- you'll either love it or hate it. I don't see myself going out of my way to recommend Assassin's Creed, but I will tell friends thinking about picking it up that they'll probably enjoy parts of it, and that it is at least worth a rental (of course, us PC users don't quite have that option). In closing, I look at Assassin's Creed and see its potential. I can see the diamond in the rough and I hope the developers take notice to what the fans and critics alike have to say about the game, because if they do some tweaking and work on the story a bit, Assassin's Creed 2 could easily be Game of the Year material whenever it decides to grace us with its presense.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The title pretty much sums it up.This game was awesome at first and I was stoked.The graphics are great and I like sandbox feeling to it. Sadly, after 1 - 2 days of playing i realized...""hey! Didn't i just do clear this mission before?"" This is game is so repetitive that I feel cheated.Further into the game the only thing that makes it more challenging is that whenever you are on a mission som retards without shirt come up to you and start pushing you around completely blowing ones cover. It's really frustrating and doesn't make any sense.Also, the voice actors are a joke.//Famicom]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a historical third-person action-adventure game which was released late last year for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 to mixed reviews from the general gaming public. The game has finally made its transition onto desktop PCs with a few additions in the form of a Director's Cut Edition as well as enhanced graphics to take advantages of the PCs computing power. However, most of the less-desirable aspects from the console versions that were responsible for the negative press end up on this PC version too and they keep Assassin's Creed from being the classic it should've been.  Arguably the best aspect of Assassin's Creed is the wonderful and unique world created for you to explore and roam around in. The world is authentic and precise in its attention to detail and the three major cities during the crusades – Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre – have been brought to life in all their glory. Archers patrol rooftops, beggars annoy you with their constant whining for money and citizens cry for help at being harassed by guards. The game also gives you complete freedom to move around these cities in any way you please with the most impressive aspect being that never does it feel as if the developers are artificially providing you with cracks and ledges to climb on. The cracks and ledges are present as part of the architecture of these various buildings with you being able to take advantage of them because of your impressive abilities. The game is also very immersive as a result of the above aspects – citizens will pause and wonder what you are doing if you don't use ladders to scale rooftops and guards will draw their blade if you run into soldiers or cause havoc too often.  If the developers show their eye for detail in the world they have created immaculately, then it is even more evident in the game's story which is presented in two parts. In the modern world, not many years in the near future, a bartender named Desmond Miles has been abducted by a mysterious group proclaiming that he holds precious information required by them. A tool called the Animus will help the group get hold of this information which is embedded Desmond's DNA as memories of his ancestors. In the past, the year is 1191 AD and the game takes place right in the middle of the crusades for the Holy Land. You are Altair, a well-trained assassin working as part of a group of… well, assassins. After a certain mishap, you are stripped of all your weapons and abilities and reduced to the level of initiate within the brotherhood and tasked with assassinating certain targets to reclaim your lost rank and pride by your master. As you proceed with these missions, both the protagonists will come to understand their part in this gripping story, and so will you as you will also build up an emotional bond with them.  The core gameplay is pretty involving in the early portions of the game but becomes quite monotonous later on where you will just want to complete them in order to get on with the story. The missions typically require you to perform a series of investigations before you can get on with the actual assassination itself. Four new investigations have been added for the PC director's cut apart from the three – pickpocketing, eavesdropping and interrogating – which were present in the console versions. These typically involve you helping other assassins with various tasks such as destroying a set number of merchant stands or escorting them to safety after which they provide you with the information you require. Though these new missions keep things from getting repetitive for a while, they do not involve investigating of any form (as compared with the original three) and hence feel quite detached from the rest of the game. Once you complete a set number of investigations, you can proceed with the assassination which mainly requires you to focus on combat and free-running.  Combat in the game controls incredibly well with the keyboard and mouse scheme provided in the game. When the game starts off with you being stripped of all your weapons and abilities, combat can take a bit of getting used to. However, as you level up in rank and regain access to such weapons as the short blade and throwing knives, as well as the ability to counterattack and dodge, the combat becomes a bit too easy and the lack of any depth becomes blatantly evident. The counterattack especially becomes overpowering as it will enable you to tackle huge numbers of enemies with considerable ease. However, one can argue that these abilities do keep the combat from ever being too frustrating and the action portions of the game are always enjoyable as a result.  Free-running is really the forte of Assassin's Creed and is perfectly implemented thanks to the architecture of the game's various buildings and Altair's fluid animations. It is also a bit of a relief that free-running is as good as it is because your general enjoyment of the game really depends on how much you like this particular aspect as well as how good you are at it. However, it is not only a gimmick because whenever you are spotted to be an assassin by the guards, the only way to get on with things is to become anonymous again by running yourself and finding safety in one of the many hiding spots available to you which is easier said than done.  Combat and free-running aside, there are certain other aspects that help keep Assassin's Creed fresh and unique when compared to other games out there. Health is shown to be the level of synchronization you have with your ancestor's memories via the animus. This can reduce due to a number of different factors and whenever you fully lose synchronization, you die and have to reload from the most recent checkpoint. There are also many extra missions that you can look to complete though they do not provide any bonuses as such. Saving citizens being harassed by guards provides you with vigilantes who block guards chasing you or scholars who can be used to hide within. Climbing viewpoints which are always the tallest buildings within cities to reveal various parts of the map as well as investigation missions is a pleasure throughout, although even these begin to repeat over time. Apart from the above two which are slightly essential to the game, you can also collect various flags which are strewn all over the cities and the countryside in-between them and attempt to scale all the view points in the map and so forth. All these extras combined with free-running will help keep your attention to the game till the end and actually compensate for some of the game's other flaws.  Assassin's Creed is raised from good to great thanks to its presentation. If you have a pretty high-end PC and can crank all the settings all the way up and have access to higher resolutions, then you are in for a visual treat. Buildings are crisply detailed with all the cracks and crevasses showing perfectly. Each city has a unique look with a visual style to complement even though it is not hard to note the fact that building architectures do repeat over cities. Character models are near-perfect and combined with the game's wonderful animations across the board, really do add to the unique setting the game takes place in. Lighting and shadowing is also pretty effective and standing on top of a view point with the sunlight streaming over Altair casting his shadow on the ground is always a wonderful picture. There are minor glitches here and there and some of the textures are a bit weak because of the game's console roots but they aren't major enough to break the deal. Also, the game is always displayed in 16:9 aspect ratio, so people with 4:3 or 16:10 monitors will see a lot of letterboxing. It is pretty frustrating that Ubisoft put a lot of effort into porting it for the PC but still ended up missing this key aspect which has not been fixed even in the 1.02 patch. However, the game is pretty stable as of the 1.02 patch and not once did it crash on my system which cannot be said of console-to-PC ports too often. All said and done, the highly polished graphics really help in bringing the game world to life as well providing it with a level of believability with the only minus being you do require quite a beefed up PC to enjoy the game in its entire visual splendor.  If the graphics are top-notch, then the sound is even better. Jesper Kyd has composed some of the best soundtracks of all-time for games such as Hitman 2: Silent Assassin and Freedom Fighters, so it should come as no surprise that his music for this game is again brilliant and nicely complements the subject matter. The music, which is suitably mellow and subtle when you are running around the city or riding on horseback in the countryside, becomes quite bombastic during battles with the usage of heavy percussion to get you pumped up. The sound probably contributes even more than the visuals to making the world as immersive as it is. On top the game's largest buildings, the sound of an eagle will fill your ears along with the smooth gush of the wind and the citizen's cry will be but a faint moan. But it's the minor details that really grab one's attention such as the sound of Altair's footsteps or the sound of the moan he utters when he scales a difficult ledge or the sounds of citizens shouting in awe at the dead body you just flung to the ground. The voice-acting is also top-notch for each of the game's major characters and really does help in getting you involved in the story right away. Albeit, the voices of citizens do begin to repeat over time but it is understandable given the number of citizens that populate these cities. There are stuttering and hitches in the sound too but there are various workarounds floating around the web that help in fixing a majority of the issues in the game. However, these issues are more annoyances than anything else and they do not bring down the overall quality of the sound which is consistently excellent throughout.  Assassin's Creed is not without its flaws, however. As mentioned, the investigation missions do become monotonous over time and the combat mechanics, while being easy, do not have enough depth to be intensely satisfying over the course of the game. There are also no manual saves of any sort and the game automatically saves your progress using a checkpoint system which can take a bit of getting used to. Another non-gameplay related minus is that it takes an eternity to quit the game by normal means which really asks a lot questions at the Ubisoft testing department. Thankfully, there is a shorter method to quit the game via pressing Alt+F4, however it never should come down to such shortcuts and it would be wise for Ubisoft to fix this via a patch. On other notes, if you play only the story part of the game, you can be done within 15-20 hours. Although, going out of your way to collect the flags and save every citizen does help in extending the time to about 25-30 hours. However, even then the game does not have enough replay value to warrant a second playthrough as the missions themselves cannot be completed in any other drastically different manner. It is to be noted that these issues only prevent the game from ever being a classic but in no way do they spoil all the fun that is to be had with it. Assassin's Creed is still a wonderful game that most anyone can enjoy thanks to its top-notch presentation, wonderful implementation of free-running, two-faceted gripping story and probably the most unique game world ever created.]]>"

Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Hard to really comment on the game to a sufficient level without giving too much of the storyline away for those who have yet to experience the majority of the game, but I'll give it a whirl. The majority of the game is set in 1191, during the third crusade in the holy land. You play the character Altaïr, an assassin after an artifact that the Knights Templar are searching for. Your initial assassination attempt goes awry, and you're sent back to your master, stripped of your rank, and are tasked with a series of 10 assassinations to regain your rank, equipment and abilities along the way. You start out in the small town of Masyaf, then you move out in the wilderness called Kingdom, from which you eventually get access to the cities of Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem. As you progress through your missions, more areas of the cities are opened up to you. Your primary assassination missions follow the same recipe each time really - visit the assassin's guild in the town you visit to start your investigation, climb some tall towers to open up more of your map and see some of the tasks you need to carry out (eavesdrop, pickpocket, beat the hell out of someone, and timed flag and assassination runs in later missions), and then once you have a certain number done, you can head back to the guild, tell them of your findings, and off you go to carry out your assassination. Despite the game doing pretty much the same for each of the different assassinations you're tasked with, the cities vary sufficiently in order for it to not become a chore - only things I started to dislike were the sheer number of beggars, drunks and insane people that get in your way in the latter missions. Aside from these, you can go collecting flags in all areas of the game, or seeking out templar knights to kill too, but these are secondary to the main story.The game's visual style is where it shines the most - the cities are simply breathtaking, and you're introduced to each one with a sweeping view as you approach it. When you've unlocked the city, it's amazing to think that it's a living, breathing city down there - no dodgy looking walls or backdrops, what you see is a city, and you can visit anywhere in it once it's unlocked, and it's all done seamlessly. It's a joy once you scale your first building and start to run, jump and climb around the rooftops, and climbing each of the different lookout points in the city never get boring, especially when you get to climb some of the massive buildings out there, such as the cathedral in Acre. Astounding. Without giving anything away, the ending of the game surprised me - I expected something a little more... well, not final, but something that felt as if the current game had actually ended? Instead, if you do a bit of digging around, there's a collection of curiosities that tells you that they could go in so many directions with sequels to the game, both forwards and backwards in time. Plenty of options there, so I look forward to where they take the franchise next. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When I first brought Assassins Creed I was really put off the game for the same reason that most people have expressed their disappointment in this game. The prospect of planning out an assassination by collecting information through eaves dropping, intimidating and pick-pocketing sounded great and the first time you did these things was really awesome. But then repetition sunk in.The problem with this game is once you have played one level you have pretty much done everything this game has to offer. The different investigations which make up the majority of the game are the same in every city each time you carry out an assassination. It was after I initially traded the game in that I began to look back at it more favorably. In my opinion this is a really great game that you should play in moderation. Playing the game through in the space of a week left the game looking mind blowingly dull. But now I pick it up every now and then and each time I always really enjoy my time with it.The actual gameplay is absolutely brilliant. The way you climb up buildings and leap around each of them is enjoyable and performing assassinations on unsuspecting guards and Templers is also a great pass-time. The combat is a little clumsy but OK and the story is really interesting.If you haven't played it yet I recommend it especially as it is much cheaper now and if like me you traded it away, give it another chance.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The game starts with a person named Desmond, played by you, in the present time, being explained about a machine called the animus by a scientist guy ( Vidic ) that lets you see memories of your ancestors. The scientist apparently wants the memories for some research which is not clearly specified in the starting, but is slowly revealed throughout the game.  So you start with a memory that begins the story of Desmond's ancestor-Altair(You). You get out of the animus at some intervals to discuss the memories with the doc and to do a little bit of present day investigation too. The story turns from interesting to absolutely amazing in the end, and therefore I'm not going to reveal it to you.  In the game you get to travel to cities like Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre, Arsuf and Mysaf through the kingdom on horseback or directly. The graphics are amazing and the shadows and the textures are greatly detailed, and if you have a high end pc, you'll get an amazing experience. There are a lot of beautiful scenes that will force you to keep taking screen shots.  The NPCs are very realistic, reacting to every move you make, like commenting on you when you start climbing buildings in front of them or jump from one.  If on a run from the guards for some reason, once you break their line of sight, you can blend in with the environment in pretty cool ways like sitting on a bench, blending with some scholars or hiding in a haystack or a rooftop garden.  The climbing and jumping part of the game is probably what made it so famous and waited for, and it feels great. You just keep a few buttons pressed and the work will be done automatically, but you will still feel as if you are doing some great work. It all is seamless and very realistic.   The city feels very alive, with the sounds of children crying, dogs barking etc. to be heard in some places, plus a huge amount of crowd moving about the city makes it even more so.  The combat part is never very difficult, but it would be an understatement to say that it is just great. You can inflict a number of different blows to your enemies like grabbing, parrying, counter attacking and the like. There may be around 20 people on the screen but you'll be able to kill them all slowly.  Assassination, as required, is one of the best parts of the game, with the hidden blade having its own coolness. You can stealth assassinate in a number of ways too, jumping on with the hidden blade, normal blade assassination, throwing knives (one shot kill, ranged) etc.  Near the end of the game and the final assassination, the similarity of the game is blown away as the plot suddenly twists leaving you dazed. The story, people and environment change so rapidly that completing the game becomes way more than worth it. It is so much fun in the end of the game, that however much you enjoyed the rest of the game, you'll enjoy the last part TEN times more. Friends and enemies all get mixed up to form one smashing climax.   You get out of the animus feeling all strange and VERY entertained, only to know that there is a lot going on in the present day as well. The only thing you will think except what you just saw and did will be - ""When is the next game going to come out?""]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is one of those games that makes a person gitty with anticipation before launch. Unfortunately this title takes a step back in innovation. Sure the player can fight multiple enemies using many different methods - hidden blade for silent kills, or throwing knives and swords while fighting multiple, over aggressive, guards - but it's been done before in other games like God of War. Even collecting information about the next target before assassinating them gets old as Altair eavesdrops, pick pockets, interrogates, and even finds view points to explore the city. Tasks that get old after awhile.  What saves this title from a bargain bin purchase is the alteration of religious themes that may seem interesting to some but may also be a little controversial to others. But even then the story driven action doesn't pick up until the game is almost over.  In the early days of this titles' creation what was held proud by the developer, Ubi Soft, doesn't seem like a big deal. Gently pushing innocent civilians aside to pass through a crowd without alerting the guards or jumping from one rooftop to the next, isn't innovative.  The controls in Assassin's Creed sometimes can get a bit frustrating when trying to escape the relentless pursuits of the city guards. For example: When pressing a particular direction on the left analog stick immediately while either climbing a latter or hopping onto a horse to ride off to safety, the calibration of the controls become inverted for a few seconds making the lead character move in the opposite direction resulting in some frustrating moments.  In a game where your being continuously chased, you don't need the controls to change on you whenever it feels like it.  Altair as the lead character is one cool dude in terms of personal conduct of how he handles himself in fights. To me personally he's up there with Solid Snake and Kratos. Even though the character developement for him isn't that great, like the other protaganists, I enjoy the mystique qualities about him.  All in all this game is worth of at least a rental. The story is great but the action oriented gameplay was too repetitious for me. But be sure to see a sequel coming in the near future as the ending leaves you with questions that need to be answered.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a well developed game that features awesome but repetitive game-play with gorgeous visuals and an intriguing storyline.  The game took a decent length of time to beat, around 10-15 hours and featured some memorable moments.  This game is similar to the Prince of Persia franchise in that it allows you to climb walls and jump between large gaps and across buildings.  If you enjoy Prince of Persia then odds are you will like this game.  The only real downside to this game is that it can be repetitive.  The game features a fighting system that you easily master and a lot of collect this so you can achieve that game-play.  Aside from the fact that the game is beautiful, the other excellent about this game is the story.  It features a matrix-type storyline where you are put into this virtual world.  It is a unique storyline and after finishing the game I wanted to know what would happen next.  I highly recommend at least renting the game for a week-end.  ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When the Assassin's Creed trailer came out almost a year ago it looked incredible: great graphics, smooth looking gameplay, and a very interesting setting. The game itself had some mixed reviews, and I've finally gotten around to playing it for myself. The setting itself is somewhat misleading, as right away you realize that the main character is actually a descendant of the assassin in the trailer, and you are tasked with unlocking the secrets of his actions. The premise is that scientists have discovered that DNA houses memory as well as normal genetic traits. Many reviewers have said that showing us this ""secret"" so early is a mistake, but after I finished the game I definitely feel that the story had to flow this way. It's not really a secret so much as the entire story revolves around this point, and some questions are answered while others are not. The flow of the game is such that Altair is the top assassin, but is extremely arrogant. He makes a grave mistake that his master forces him to atone by way of assassinating nine men. There are 4 main cities, three of which basically look exactly the same. Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus all have the same look at feel (even the buildings and citizens look exactly the same). This didn't distract me a great deal, but I couldn't shake the feeling of just how much better the game would be if each city has it's own distinct look and feel. The control is very good, and most of the game plays basically like an open world Prince of Persia game. One major exception being that stealth is the most important gameplay element. Moving, fighting (when necessary), jumping and climbing all feel great and are done well. The controls do get a touch sloppy when you're being chased--the game often misreads that you're trying to run when you're actually trying to hid in bale of hay, etc.--but it's more of a slight annoyance rather than a major problem. Combat is solid as well, although I would have liked to see a more robust combo system similar to the Prince of Persia games to add more variety and a better sense of tactics. I don't want to give much away about the story, as this is where the game truly shines, but the flow of the game basically goes like this: the master gives you someone to assassin, you go to the appropriate city, speak to city's head assassin at the guild, complete 3 investigations to gather information, return to the guild to review your assassination plan, complete the assassination, return to the master to receive weapon/ability upgrades and your next assassination mission. There are some variants here and there, but each of the nine assassination missions go exactly like that more or less. This is the game's biggest weakness because it gets pretty repetitive especially towards the middle of the game. The very interesting part is when the game goes back to the present day, and your character learns more and more about why he is there, who exactly has him there, and what the motive is behind all of this. As the game moves along, you find out that there are really two stories going on at the same time. Both are very interesting and the game does a great job going back and forth between the two to keep you interested and engaged. Overall Assassin's Creed is a very strong action/adventure game; the best I've yet played on the PS3. The graphics are great, the gameplay is solid, the story is outstanding, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen in a video game. This is a great game that I would recommend to almost everyone, and I can't wait for the sequel.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ No pun intended, but in Ubisoft's new game Assassin's Creed, that execution is somewhat disappointing.  In a lot of ways, Assassin's Creed is a whole lot of fun if you can take it for what it is, but exactly what this game IS can be somewhat hard to define.  Story-wise, Assassin's Creed is a relatively strong game.  You'll play as Desmond Miles, a former assassin in the modern day who has since gone legit., becoming a bartender and leaving behind his past.  That is, until he's abducted by a pair of scientists whose work is concerned SOLELY in the past.  They toy with the idea that animals, as well as humans have something called genetic memory, which allows them to understand things that their predecessors did without any first-hand experience.  They place Desmond in a machine called an Animas that lets him relive the past memories of his ancestors, and as such, have him reliving the life of his ancestor Altair, an assassin during the Crusades tasked with killing 9 important leaders to ""bring about peace"" to the Holy Land.  How these two realities relate to one another reveals itself throughout the game, and overall, the story is one of the stronger parts of the game. Then we get into the actual game.  Watching Assassin's Creed, one will notice it's a very good looking game.  The settings look very authentic, Altair moves with a certain grace and style that is actually very fun to watch.  The rest of the citizens of the cities don't necessarily share his good-looks, but considering how many of them that there are, it's not really a flaw, so to speak.  The lighting is actually one of the best in any game engine, and hopefully in the future, Ubisoft will use it in future games. Gameplay, which should be the high point of the game, is actually when the game starts to come unglued.  There are some really cool things to do in Assassin's Creed.  Altair can pretty much climb on any surface that sticks out far enough for him to get a handhold on, and you can move along the rooftops, rafters, dive off towers and become lost in the crowd to camoflauge from guards and to get close to your assassination targets.  When it does come to fighting, you're gonna have some options whether you want to try and take enemies out stealthily with your hidden blade, from a distance with throwing knives, or use one of Altair's swords to fight enemies head on.  During these fights, you can slash at enemies normally, but your most efficient fighting skill's gonna be Altair's counter kill.  It's a neat little trick that lets you counter a move and follow up with a sweet looking attack of your own.  It's definitely fun to watch, but then it turns into every battle being the same, since this technique is just so darn effective.  Put your guard up, watch for somebody to attack, counter kill, repeat.  It gets repetitive. And that's Assassin's Creed's biggest problem.  You'll be doing the same thing... a lot... over and over and over again.  You need to do investigations to get to assassinations, which involves only about 4 different kinds of missions, and you'll be doing these before EVERY... SINGLE... ONE of the games 9 assassinations.  You'll need to find viewpoints to find these investigations, and you'll be climbing similar looking towers before EVERY... SINGLE... ONE of those investigations.  But hey, that'd be fine if there were some variety in side missions.  Sadly... there aren't.  It just feels like Ubisoft created this world, but forgot to give you something to do.  Assassinations are good fun, and there is a lot that you can do to make your own fun (ie climbing, killing random people) but since you're doing these things enough just playing the game, this too gets old after a while. The sound in Assassin's Creed is a mixed bag.  The soundtrack and crowd noise sets a really nice atmosphere for Assassin's Creed, and there's a lot for your ears to get into here.  The voice actors all do a decent job, save the actor who plays Altair himself.  Where all the other guys sound realistically from the town period, Altair sticks out like a sore, Hayden Christiansan-esque, thumb.  Other than that, the rest of the respective sound effects sound up to par, and the game overall sounds good. It's not that Assassin's Creed is a bad game, it just seems like for a game that made so many promises during development, it doesn't really shine through as anything really new, breakthrough, or particularly creative.  Not that a game must break the mold to be good, but this game made claims that it just doesn't uphold, and is overall just not that much fun to play for that long.  It's repetitive, but does have some life in it.  By no means is it not worth a play, just be sure you realize what you're getting into when you fire up that disc.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When i first saw this game at E3 I was stoked it was one of my most anticipated games of the year it was innovative and had some incredibly stunning visuals. I waited about a week after it was released and decided to rent it. And what an awesome decision that was. Good:Has a cool sandbox feel to itStoryline  was well done but could have had more added to itVisuals are great especially when you climb towersThere are alot off inovative aspects not seen in many games.Bad:THE MOST REPETITIVE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, SERIOUSLY           There is no variation at all between bosses besides maybe there appearance. Each mission is redicullously identical and leaves thinking you have done each mission over and over again.Also levels are built in a way  that makes getting away either way to easy or way to hard there is no real median to balance it out. There are also small nuscances such as walls that  you know youve climbed before suddenly deny when running away and take mulitple attempts to scaleITS REALLY REPETITIVE]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I knew about this game when it was first ever even freakin conceived and I had been waiting since then for this game. I waited for this game for 2 years reserved it 4months early and got it the first day it came out. And it was all totally worth it. It is easily one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is amazingly smooth for all that you can do. The environments are huge and totally interactive. IGN said this game had poor replay value and I beat it in 4 days and I'm still playing it. There one thing that bugs me though I can't find a way up the assassins fortress building which if I could would be the tallest building. The only bad thing about this game, and its not really that bad, is that it has some visual glitches here and there. One thing I noticed about what they did with this game is that no matter how far away you are from and object or building it doesn't lose its detail. This game is a must buy for everyone. It is revolutionary to say the least. Brace yourself for the ending ( don't throw your controller).P.S. There has to be a second game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What was GIANT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Presentation > Looks absolutely amazing! The old cities look outstanding. Goodbye Gears and COD4, the new graphics champion is here!- Climbing/Jumping > Really well done as far as animation goes (average control scheme), the views up top are breathtaking.- Crowds > Walking through the crowd is revolutionary, has some issues with incorrect animations showing up but overall it's a great achievement.- Stealth > The ability to kill enemies using stealth is really cool, I wish they used the Splinter Cell engine, it would've been way better.- Animations > Be it your character, the combat moves, horse motion etc. the animation is second to none, very well done!- Kills > Even though the combat controls are weak, once you get used to them the kills are very satisfying and varied. However the controls are not consistent and poorly done. The key is to hit the right trigger and wait for an enemy to attack then click X for a counter attach, rinse-repeat.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What BOMBed~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Controls > Can get really frustrating in Combat situations. Not as good as expected especially the climb/combat controls, it takes a while getting used to the controls and holding the right trigger all through combat is not very creative. Same thing goes when going in a blend position, you have to keep your A button pressed all the time, it should go prone on first click then back to normal on second click.- Story > I wish they dropped the sci-fi and stuck with history mostly, it seems every game/movie wants to tie some science experiment time-travel stuff that is really not needed here. You go through the pain of recreating this fantastic old world and detailed cities etc. and then you mess it all up with futuristic elements, bad call!!!- AI > You can sometimes ""cheat"" the AI and kill enemies right in front of them and they will let you go, it also lacks consistency, you might trigger alerts when there shouldn't be any.- Character motion > Feels a bit clunky in places, sometimes stops in unexpected spots but the effort to break new ground is appreciated.- Repetitive > Missions are extremely repetitive but I do enjoy running over the buildings and getting to the high points.- Tutorial > Insufficient, should have more detail/controls. Pick-pocketing can be a pain, again weak control scheme.- Sandbox > In some spots, you think you can reach certain places but it won't allow you to.- Achievements > I can't stand collecting items and there's way too many of these.- Exit game > Should have a more obvious and faster quit option.- Co-op > Would've been quite an interesting plus. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[After two years of hype I finally got to play through Assassins Creed. A game that has surprisingly refined controls if you ask me. It feels like Spider-man meets Prince of Persia with a little GTA thrown in for good measure. But it doesn’t outright copy any single part of those titles. And those parts add up to something great. It has flaws but I feel like the game is owed something positive after being criticized for repetition. There’s not another game like it around. You can’t say that very often. Usually every game gets compared to ever other game.  Assassins Creed starts out almost disappointingly as far as my expectations went for the story. I avoided spoilers for a long time so I went into it with screenshots of a roof jumping guy during the crusades literally burned into my mind….And then I started a new game. I’m a guy in the future, in a hooded sweater, beside a mind reading machine bed called the Animus. His name is Desmond. My initial reaction is pretty shocked. Already the game has let me down by fooling me into thinking it was something else. How often does the idea of the future with flashbacks work? It’s just so rare in any form entertainment. It’s a clunky way of telling any cohesive story and comes off as goofy. So I hear this old man talking about a bunch of science and blah. And the woman named Lucy going on about whatever. Then I start the real game I had read about. It begins pretty slow for an action game. And one of my bigger complaints throughout the game is prevalent here. I’m the guy that skips cut-scenes when I know they’re pointless. The intro is just that. You know your little village in the hills is under attack. Then you get to listen to the “mentor” in the story tell you a bunch of things. The game has fairly cryptic dialogue so it makes it hard to pay attention. I have trouble with slow pacing. It’s a grey area because you want the player to know the story, and you don’t want anything to be missed. But at the same time, it’s almost fan service for over half the cut-scenes. The basic plot is outlined and in-between there’s just so much information that ultimately leads you nowhere. Then you do a bunch of stuff, and finally get to leave Masyaf. The horse riding mechanics are pretty bad. Tank control bad. Connecting each of the four major cities is a place called The Kingdom and it’s just a bunch of snaking roads with ruins spread out. Up to this point I wasn’t impressed. It was when I got to  that the game finally lived up to what it promised. It’s the first city you go to and after you scale that first tall building to find targets you realize the potential. Each wall is like its own puzzle when you climb it. Finding ledges and areas to grab, etc. The three major cities, , , and , have three separate districts. Poor, Middle, and Rich. And each district has a set of investigations, free missions (saving a citizen/lookouts), and an assassination target. You find the headquarters in each city for mission briefings. This is where that repetition comes in. You talk to the guy, he tells you to find more info, and you go out to perform 2-3 required investigations. Those involve Pick-pocketing, interrogations, and listening in on conversations. Then you get to the assassination. That’s it. So when people talk about repeating things, that’s why. You do the same 2-3 investigations nine times. Nine targets, divided into three districts of three cities. It’s that simple. And that’s where I disagree with all the negativity because you have to look beyond that. For one, the game is gorgeous. The graphics are jaw-dropping. I never encountered frame-rate issues. Everything looks so darn good. Each city has its own architecture which leads to its own challenges. When I said climbing a wall was like a puzzle, it’s also a new puzzle for every city. In  for example, there’s a lot of brick walls that can’t be climbed, like a fortress. But in  it feels a little older and there are cracks in the walls, more ledges, etc. And I think that’s part of the difficulty increasing. Instead of easy, normal, and hard it’s done through AI awareness and the city architecture. Even the separate districts look significantly different from each other. Poor districts tend to have more places to grab onto because of deterioration and wear. Climbing is as simple as holding a button and navigating the wall. Altair is so easy to control you feel like you can do anything. He’s nimble and fast. You choose to be stealthy or violent to get any job done. You have a sword, throwing knives (I loved those), a short blade, and a retractable knife under your sleeve. With the retractable knife, the animations are pretty awesome. You walk up behind somebody and push the assassination button. Altair then takes care of business. It just rules. You can drop guys in the streets without anyone noticing. There’s also a combo system. It works the same as the counter system, in which you press X immediately after making contact with an enemy sword. It’s timing basically. Makes a one hit kill and saves time. I defend the repetition because there’s a huge difference between doing things over and over, and having fun doing it. Here, I was repeating missions but they were fun, especially attempting them in different environments. It might have been a market, a dock, or a castle. It made for different ways of executing the objective. And that’s most of the game. So after you get to the ninth mission it slows down again. Reaching that point I felt like I would be finishing up soon. Little did I know there was about two hours of game left! This was the other huge issue. The game drags on. I was forced to jump through hoops battling off waves of enemies trying to reach the “true” final assassination. It’s there you find out that these templars (nine of them, plus one spoiler character) found something in that first temple and it’s the Piece of Eden. You kill the spoiler character and activate the piece. It reveals a map showing where the pieces are around the world. This is what Abstego industries has been looking for, and why they kidnapped Desmond. Since Desmond’s ancestor, Altair, had seen where they were located. The game ends on a huge cliffhanger. The Templars are actually the founders of Abstego industries and are looking for the pieces. If you wait around the end of the game long enough you can go into Desmonds room, use eagle vision, and see markings on his wall. The markings are for a Mayan date predicting the end of the world. Very cool.  It’s a pretty great game. I listened to a pod-cast recently. One of the lead developers from Uncharted: Drakes Fortune was on. And she had mentioned that Assassin's Creed gave the player too much freedom. And that when you’re in a cut-scene you can walk around and that removes you from the game. I tend to agree with her on that and a few other choices they made. The basic premise has laid the groundwork for a wonderful franchise and these little complaints will be fixed in the future.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition (PC)[review originally posted on the Adventure Gamers forums]So I finally had a chance to play this, specifically the PC ""Director's Cut"" version which is different in its greater variety of side-missions (adding Rooftop Race, Merchant-Stand Destruction, Archer Assassination and Assassin Escort).I loooove the exploration. I like how intuitive the Parkour is, allowing you to focus on being awesome rather than having to think about the steps required to achieve awesome.I'm not sure I buy into the reasoning behind Altair forgetting how to dodge and grab ledges as he's stripped of his rank at the start of the game, but once you've run some missions and regained your station you've got a pretty sweet arsenal of skills at your fingertips. And it's literally fingertips as the buttons on the 360 pad - still on the PC - correspond to your weapon hand, your free hand, your eyes and your legs... with the right trigger acting as a switch between high- and low profile, each action depending on context. So for example using your free hand in low profile allows you to gently push past your fellow pedestrians, while using it in high profile will let you grab and throw them.The game's historical setting is something truly special. Three great ancient cities are brought to life in startling detail: Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus, each of them with its own distinctive ambiance. Truly a marvel. It's a bit of a shame then that the game's over-arching narrative is so at odds with it. We are thrust into the shoes of Desmond Miles, a modern-day bartender kidnapped by some shadowy corporation for the purpose of 'exploring his genetic memory', specifically that of his Hashshashin ancestor Altair in the Holy Land of 1191. It's all very ""meta"" and, while kind of interesting, strikes me as ultimately unnecessary, lacking the elegance of Sands of Time.It would have been okay if they'd reserved the Matrixy glitches for when the 'simulation' was actually breaking down or initializing (such as in the first few moments, or when loading memories) but hints of fakery are found throughout: on collectible flags, on the glowing selection effect and on the goddamn popups that appear all the time long after you've finished all tutorials.At least you can turn the HUD off.Actually, the game was at its best I found when played entirely blind. That is to say, forget the GPS, don't even use the map more than once or twice and just explore... Climb a few towers to figure out where you are. Once you've done a few missions it's easy enough to recognize what you're looking for (eg Assassin's Bureau) and with 'sixth sense' vision it's easy enough to pick out your targets if you take the time.Which is why I was surprised at the highly arbitrary time limits imposed on some side-missions. Why you had to do the standard Stealth Assassination in minutes when you could take your sweet time with the Archer Assassination I have no idea, but neither I think were in any hurry to leave town. Same with the (corrupt) Merchant-Stand Destruction. When you're being chased by guards because you just buried one of their colleagues in a pile of wood and assorted groceries it's kinda hard to slip away and anonymously report back to your buddy in under three minutes. Sans the time-pressure would have been more enjoyable.Also I would like to know how Altair back in 1191 managed to do the Rooftop Race Challenge without functioning GPS. I can suspend disbelief on the haystack diving for gameplay purposes, but this is stretching it.Given how free-form most of the game is, it's a bit perplexing that when the time comes for your target to die you are often required to move to a very specific position before events start to unfold in semi-cutscene form. When the talking starts you're still able to move around, but you cannot choose to move in and cut the monologue short with a well-placed stab in the back. It's only when the cinematic is over that you may proceed... In some missions this is more restrictive than others as often there's still enough room to act on your own terms, but just as often you will find yourself in highly impractical and conspicuous locations. It kind of defeats the purpose of all that careful preparation.The main criticism leveled at Assassin was repetition, which I don't think weighs as heavily now as it did for the 360 version. As long as you don't try to rush it there's plenty variety to keep you entertained till the credits roll.The game looks and sounds amazing. If you've got a rig that can handle it - I was able to hijack my housemate's PC for the purpose - and turn it up to full settings it is the stuff that blows minds. There's some issues with level of detail here and there and the aforementioned intentional glitches somewhat diminish the atmosphere but it never ceases to be genuinely awesome. The animation and the way it ties into interaction with the crowd and the environment is nothing short of groundbreaking.So the verdict in the end? It's not perfect. Still, I can't help but love this game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed is set in the modern era; you play Desmond miles a bar tender that is kidnapped and brought to a building belonging to Abstergo Industries. The reason for this is because Desmond had an ancestor who was u betcha an assassin. Desmond’s ancestor was an assassin during the third crusades who was responsible for the assassination of well known figures during the third crusades. After the kidnapping Desmond is laid down on a machine known as the animus where his sub conscious relays images from the third crusades. While in these images he sees you are instructed to assassinate 11 influential figures during the third crusades after doing so you complete the game only to be left wondering what’s next. The battle system in assassin’s creed is strung together quite well, when attacking an opponent you have the option of a proper old fashion sword/dagger fight or either creep up to the enemy and perform a stealth kill with a nice looking dagger/knife. When fighting a group or single enemy you will fight with a sword, dagger or throwing knifes the combat is initiated with one button while you are locking on that specific opponent. The defensive side to the fights are quite well done, you can either Block an attack if you time it right or evade the attack, after which your character will kill the enemy or either kick or punch them to the ground. The graphics in assassin’s creed are quite well done; the buildings and surrounding landscapes are very nicely polished. All four cities are all individual with different artistic style due to the fact they are based on real cities of the time but they do a very nice job in capturing what I can only imagine they would have looked like. AI in this game is very nice they all interact with their surroundings react to you if you manage to bump into them or push them over while on lookers will gasp and even sometimes run (pussies). From the bustling streets of the cities where you will hear every noise from a screaming women down to the whispers of peasants. The audio plays a great role in telling the story and drawing you in to the story; the voice acting is done well and compliments what is a solid game. Overall I was happy with my time spent playing assassins creed it definitely taught me a thing or too about the third crusades well maybe not so much. I say to you if you have the time and money it’s a game worth buying.  ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed had alot of hype behind it, and after 3 years of being developed gamers had very high expectations. Too high perhaps. The hype kinda knocked it off course and as a result AC held mixed reviews from most publications. The sad thing is, and this may just be me, is that I was never really hyped about Creed. Hell I never even read a preview on the game until the last few months before release. As a result, Assassins Creed is more like a suprise than anything. But Sometimes I don't like surprises.Assassins Creed has a deep and strange plot that has tie in's to time travel. Yes, time travel. The Story seems confusing at first....Let me restate that. The story is ALWAYS confusing. The gamer who plays either needs a damn notebook or have ahelluva good memory in terms of strange references. The ending is a cliff hanger and the supernature elements in the past and the Back to the future, sci-fi elements are what turned me off a tad bit. There's some good moments that occur and I will admit I really did enjoy watching altiar find himself throughout the game, but the plot is so strange in the present world that I cannot seem to care all that much.Visually this game looks stunning. Walking ontop of a ridge overlooking an entire city perked upon your horse is breath taking. The cities themselves are not at pretty up close. The buildings look largely the same and people are pretty numb both in personality/behavior and in apperence. The Sound design is okay, with typical voice acting and some cool sounding sword noises in between. The music is sub par but fits the game well.Assassin's Creed does have one thing going for it though and that is that it sure can be fun to play. And at other times its terrible. First the good: Its a lot of fun running around and scaling the walls etc. The AI is pretty cunning which makes for some intense on foot escapes. The Combat is also pretty solid with a basic set of attack and the ability to pull off some totally badass counter moves (These are the best part and really the only good part) in fights. About 10 or 12 hours in, the game becomes hella repetitive and can actually become flat out boring. There's also the fact that the missions (or information jobs) suck. They include fun things like pick pocketing, and easdropping...oh yeah...sounds fun eh...No, HELL no. You'll have the chance to do 9 assassinations and all of them are actually the fun part as they are all unique and all play out very different. But thats it. The game is so very barebones and clambering walls can be slow at times and kinda pisses you off during moments you wanna escape. Overall Assassins Creed is fun...but a fairly weak overall package, a 3 outta 5]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed has you play as Altair, a legendary assassin in the year 1191 A.D. That is all I will say about the story so that I don't accidently spoil it for you. It is something you need to experience for yourselves.Altair has a few different weapons. They are a long sword, a short sword, throwing knives, fists, and the assassin's blade.  The combat works well, but occasionally has its problems. Altair has amazing acrobatical abilities. He can climb, and leap over almost anything. Although, there is the occasional ""WTF, I should be able to climb this."" object. Also, the acrobat noves are also sometimes hard to use. This leads us to the mission structure, which is the gameplays biggest fault. It is just too repetitive. You ride to the city, climb a few view points, then do at least 3 out of 5 missions, then assasinate the target. The missions are either eaves droppings, interogations, informer assations or flag collecting, and pick poketings. Repeating these same few mission types over and over isn't very fun and gets annoying after a while. Then there are also side quests like rescuing citizens, and collecting flags. Rescuing citizens helps you build up your health meter. But collecting the hundreds of flags scattered throughout the world seems like it was only added for achievements and have no effect on the story.The sound in the game is good. There is some good music. The voice acting is the best part of the games sound. The people in the world sound like they are really from those parts of the world, (Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus, and Masyaf,) except Altair himself. Which is kind of lazily explained in the story. That is the review. i reccomend that you rent Assassin's Creed first to see if you like it, or buy it used.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Where do I begin?       I bought this game recently even though it came out nearly a year   ago. Why wait so long?  As most games that go into your backlog,   you just don't have time to keep up during the Christmas period.  So after booting up the game and learning that the graphics did   impress as I have heard, I was a little disheartened at how awkward   the controls felt at first...but then I realized I just suck and in no   time I was scaling walls with no problems. Boy does it feel good to be   an assassin.  I've heard this game is repetitive and YES, it can be but how could   you subtract too many points for that when the rest of it is so   awesome.  I've done so many insanely cinematic stealth kills by   the end of the game to really care how many of those were just, KILL   RANDOM GUY XXXXXX.  Ok so saving my 100th civilian from harm did   get a little irritating by the end but I still appreciate what   Assassins Creed brought to the table in terms of game play...and story The story is what makes up for the ""grind"" that you must   pass to progress through the game. You play as Desmond, a prisoner   being held by an organization that wants vital information   that’s stored in your memory.  WHAT?  Yeah you're   actually some dude who's forced to bring up memories of your ancestor   who was an assassin so that you could find some ""treasure"".   This is all done via a ""matrix"" type device. Overall, I thought this game was awesome and well worth the time   invested.  If you're looking for a game you may have skipped to   keep you busy, consider Assassins Creed if you haven't already played it.  I give this game a 4/5]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed takes place in four different cities including Jerusalem where you're an assassin named Altiar who's on a mission to kill those appointed by your leader. In this game your able to do parkour which is a sport kinda like freerunning. You're given a variety of weapons such as a sword to a hidden blade that enables you to stealth assassinate people without getting caught. What stands out in this game is that everything can be reacted to and at the same time still able to make the surrounding area unbelieveably real. Throughout the story you unlock new weapons and moves that can be really helpful throughout the game. As you progress through the storyline you begin to question of what you are doing and the reasoning for it only to find out what is really happening. The time of the place actually takes in the future where you're abducted and given orders to do a series of missions in order to unlock a memory that your abductors want, but in order to do this you have to relive the events of your ancestors memory in order to unlock this memory block. There isn't much to unlock when you go scouting for flags around the city once you finish the game but you can replay the missions. There are downsides to it including some graphical glitches that can be fixed with an upgrade. It may be a great game but there's no online play and tends to get a but repetetive. Overall, its a buyer if you're into those games that has that splinter cell feeling in my opinion. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I just got this game recentlly, having ignored it for a long time due to poor reviews. I've been very pleasantly surprised. First, it's just drop-dead gorgeous. So gorgeous my wife acutally asked me about it: ""what was that amazing looking game you were playing?"" Second, when everything comes together, it's just awesome to play. Frantically running from the guards, bounding across the rooftops, quietly assasinating someone on the street and calmly walking away...perfect.Sadly, it doesn't always come together. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it gets very, very repetitive. Ride your horse to the city. Go to the guild. Climb all the towers. Do all the investigations. Do the assasination. Return to guild. Rinse, repeat. Though the individual bits are still fun, it can be a little difficult to bring yourself to do it all over again. The repetitiveness occurs in the voice acting too -- the dozenth time you hear a saved citizen say the exact same thing is a little tiresome.Flaws aside, it's worth playing if you have any love of stealth-style games.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a third-person stealth game.The primary goal of the game is to complete nine assassinations which can be completed by a number of ways, before any assassination becomes available you need to preform different tasks like speaking to informers, eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing. you also have the chance to help citizens that are being threatened or harassed by city guards, these certain tasks only become available however once you have climbed a high point to map out the city. killing templars and collecting flags are also some of the side quests available.The combat is more of a button mash at first but the further you progress through the game the more moves you unlock, the best and most useful being counter attack. the fights are enjoyable but can be frustrating when reinforcements appear very quickly forcing you into battle. you can throw guards into nearby wooden structures to send them collapsing and taking out everyone close to it or hit them from long range with a throwing knife, throwing guards of buildings of stabbing them from behind with your hidden blade is also available.Blending will become very important after killing certain targets or when your trying to escape from guards. hiding in the rooftop canapes, sitting down on a bench or blending in with scholars are all possible and effective ways.The story behind assassins creed is a little loose and doesn't provide much closure at the end of the game. the constant talking in the game is one of its downfalls along with the repetitiveness of each assassination, the main objective of each mission is always the same and is only forgiven because of the vast citys which are different for each assassination.if you have a 360 your missing out not having this in your collection, it will get repetitive in the later parts of the game but all the good points more than out weigh that. if you haven't played it, you really should. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Everything about Assassin's Creed looks brilliant.  The art style is inspired, the interface is simple, yet effective, the free running concept is well implemented and fun to do, and the fighting mechanism is also fun and engaging.  At face value Assassin's Creed is a five star game, and I would love to give it five stars, I would love to love this game.... but I cant.  The reason I cant is because of the mission design.  The missions represent the core game play of Assassin's creed and I must say most of them are quite lame, to put it mildly.  Let's go over the various mission types.Pick Pocket - In this mission type you have to pick-pocket somebody to get some sort of information.  To do this you walk behind him, press and hold the appropriate button to stick out your hand, and then move the stick to position your hand over the person's purse, which is always in the same place.  It takes all of two seconds and is very easy to do.  This is a core mission type that you have to repeat over and over.Eavesdrop - Step one : Sit on a bench.   Step 2 : Look at the dude you want to eavesdrop on.  Step 3: Press a button.  That's it.  That's all.  No more.  The game tells you when you're in an eavesdropping area, and its extreemly obvious who you have to target.  Now if sitting on a bench and pressing a button is your cup of tea, then this game is for you.  This is a core mission type that you have to repeat over and over.Interrogation - This is a little more advanced than pick-pocketing, but not much.  Follow a dude.  He'll eventually go around a corner into a more isolated area.  At this point you beat him up in a fist fight.  He will put up a fight, and you may actually get punched, but fighting without a sword is not so much fun, rather its more of a mindless pushing buttons experience.  I never once lost a fight, or failed an interrogation on the first try.  This is a core mission type that you have to repeat over and over.Collecting Flags - Some missions have you collect some flags strewn about the area within a time limit.  This is accompanied by some ridiculous back-story about why it's urgent that you run around this area and collect flags.  Basically you have to free run over a path the developers prescribed for you.  Being that free-running is part of this mission type I actually found it to be quite fun.  That being said you only have to do it a few times during the game.  Figures that the game type I enjoyed was limited throughout the game, then again if it occurred more often I might have grown sick of it.Assassinations - The name of the game.  These are legitimately fun and do have a sense of tension about them, especially when you can't be seen.  You do, however, only have to play the specific missions types where you can't be seen a couple of times during the game.  All other times you simply can't be seen killing your target.  At first this can be tricky, but once you get the hang of it it gets kind of easy.  This also repeatedly occurs during the game, and every boss character must be assassinated.  To locate missions on your map Altair must free run around the city and find towers to climb up.  Once on top of the tower Altair looks around and in this moment you see all of the promise of the game.  The process of ascension is fun and the payoff is big.  The vistas atop the towers are impressive.  That's when the honeymoon ends and the trite conventions of the game take over.  Instead of having a fun way to descend the tower, instead all you have to do is take a leap of faith of the top and you will fall many stories to conveniently land in a pile of hay.  The developers have gone to painstaking lengths to make the game mechanics and actions believable only to drop you ten stories into a small pile of hay.  On what planet can anybody fall ten stories into a pile of hay and be alright.  Is it really necessary to inject this kind of contrivance into the game?The most fun I had was with the non-essential side mission of saving pedestrians from bullying patrols.  Although this breaks the stealth game play concept, it is lots of fun to take on a handful of guards, and rewarding when the pedestrian thanks you.  However, after a while the messages of gratitude start to get recycled.  Would it really have been that hard to record 75 different thank you messages?  That is only a small grievance. Equally as fun as the side missions is when you get busted and have to run away from the patrols.  This fluidly incorporates the free running mechanic and the fighting mechanic.The Assassin's Creed team seems to have gone to great lengths to create a living breathing environment, and allow you to interact with that environment at an extraordinary level.  It seems that after they finished accomplishing this great feat, they didn't know what to do with it.  Its really a shame considering what this game should have been.That being said there are a lot of awesome aspects to this game, and in my estimation they make up half of the experience.  The other half is dull, repetitive, overly simplistic game play.  That being said I'm giving this game half of a full score.  Hopefully they'll make a sequel to this game and execute the mission structures the right way.  There is a lot of potential in this series.  In Assassin's Creed though, that potential is failed.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The premise for assassins creed is great, a stealth game set in medieval Jerusalem. if it's done authentically with attention to detail then that in itself could be the makings of something special. Why add American scientists probing DNA strands to trace the lineage of the assassin back to relive his ancestors memories?...I have no idea. For me this clumbsy plot mechanic totally spoils the immersion into the rich game world that is set out before Altair. Then there's Altair himself, why is he the only one with a snide American accent when everyone else speaks with a middle eastern inflection? Why can he not hide the bodies of his victims so he doesn't alert the guards ala 47 in Hitman? I find Altair an unlikeable character, there are many times during the game where I longed for the ability to have some influence on Altair's spoken interaction with the games characters. A light roleplaying element with minor consequences definitely would have improved my chances of putting up with Altair who is basically a hotheaded egoist. For the first hour of play I felt left out, I made no decisions and I didnt have to really think about anything while the game held my hand through laborious tutorial stages. Then just as I felt ready to explore the medieval city I had to play as Altair's descendant walking around with nothing much to do other than listen to wooden dialouge and walk PAINFULLY SLOWLY around the place, for what seemed like a long, long time.  I persevered and managed to plough on into the game, The mission structures are unfortunately very linear, and ""side-quests"" of eavesdropping, pick pocketing and intimidating for information are bland and increbibly repetative excuses to lengthen the game. Escaping after the assassination has taken place is an exciting part of the game however the controls, for all their imagination just don't seem to cut it when you find yourself in a pinch. It takes a while to get used to the controls in this game, they've taken the context sensitive idea (like in Hitman where the options assigned to buttons is displayed in the top right) and taken it a step further so context sensitivity dominates the entire control scheme. Some gamers may enjoy this system, unfortunately I'm not one of them. Give me an honest JUMP button please!  You need a lot of patience with this game since in order to play like an assassin you'll need to walk really slowly across large distances in order not to get attacked by the tetchy guards (all of whom keep a photo of you emailed to their blackberries that they use for reference!), who won't even let you canter a horse past them.  Overall, Assassins Creed looks fantastic and had a lot of potential to be a great game but it totally flounders on one crucial ingrediant. The game just isn't fun, it's a rather dull rinse and repeat experience with a flimsy plot. All of this is a great shame considering the care and attention that has been lavished on the game world, with all the streets and rooftops that you can climb to a chorus of villagers who'll stand there watching and repeating the eternal question: ""what is that man doing? is he mad?"" I recommend trying this out on a rental as you may like it, a lot of people think it's the greatest game ever. I disagree, Assassin's Creed clearly doesn't stand shoulder to shoulder with games like Bioshock, Orange Box, COD4, Halo 3 (yes I know these are all of a different genre but nevertheless they are of a much higher overall quality), So right now i'm just like Assassin's WHAT? and I'm waiting for the next Hitman game! ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed tells the story of Altair.........'s descendant Desmond, who, for reason's unfolding during the game, was kidnapped and thrown into a machine so that the company could read his memories and blah blah blah blah. The stories not bad, and well told/interesting enough to be followed but honestly I think most people got this game to run around a huge city, climbing on buildings, and sneaking up stealthy and killing people; and to that effect Assassin's Creed delivers, for the most part. All the cities look wonderful, and they are gigantic. When they say you can go anywhere, they mean it (once all the entire city is unlocked).  The H.U.D. is pretty simple, and from my experience rather user friendly. It's easy to tell if someones about to attack you or not. Assassinations look pretty cool, and it's nice to have the option to do a stealthy kill or a high profile, ""look at me I'm jabbing a blade into someones face"", kill. It's also pretty cool that you can escape by climbing on buildings and running across the city by rooftop. The combat is........well it's simple. In the beginning of the game (after your weapons are taken away) you can execute a simple combination, and do slashing attacks. Once you unlock the counter attack feature, Combat takes on a much simpler role. Block and wait to counter, once that happens, you execute a one hit killing move and that's done with. Gets slightly tiresome to keep doing this but honestly I wasn't looking for an indepth fighting game with this. It would've been nice for combat to have been fleshed out alittle more, but you're supposed to be a master assassin so pulling of crazy sword counters seems fitting. Graphics wise, it's beautiful. Easily one of the best looking games out. The city is huge and very rarely (if ever) do you see any sort of dip in the framerate. You can look out off of a high point in the city and see every building with not problem. Textures don't have any problems loading, everything just works. The only downside is occassionally you'll see some technical ""hick ups"". Sometimes guards or Altair, sort of, do things that wouldn't happen. Like Altair's sword hitting left of a guard and the move still being executed, or a few times I had soldiers disappear mid- counter. So you'll experience those types of problems, less then often, but more then normal. Free running is awesome in this game, and not very hard at all. You'd think that it would be better for it to be a complex operation but in the midst of running from every guard from here to Palestine it's nice to be able to fluidly move.Now for the big complaints. One: You can't skip dialog scenes. At the beginning of ever mission you are greeted with a very long dialog scene from your mentor. The scenes are usually 3+ minutes and unskippable. This gets really irritating when you want to do less talking and more stabbing. This also gets really irritating when you shove your blade into your targets back, only to have him have enough life and frame of mind to have a 4 minute monologue ready for you. Honestly if you go up and stab someone in the spine or face, I don't think they'll have enough breath/frame of mind to sit there and explain why what you did was wrong. Second: Side missions are a very repetitive affair. For every assassination (there's about 9 I believe) you will have to do atleast 3 or so side missions. There are only about 5 side missions in the whole game, and they are forever repeating. Now, mind you, I did every side mission in the game because I wanted to get the most out of it, and it took me awhile to beat because I would get bored of it and put it down for a week. However doing all the side missions makes the main assassination easier to escape from. I just wish that Ubisoft had but in more side missions. Hell I wish ubisoft put in more assassinations.  It's just constantly doing the same three side missions is alittle, odd.All in all, a great game, but it leaves you with a sense that it could've been alot more. No regrets though, worth it despite it's pitfalls. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,<![CDATA[First of all let me say that assassins creed is a great game. You are an ex assassin whose memory is being tapped into from his ancestors which just happened to be assassins as well. Without giving to many plot points away this game plays on a lot of very significant historical events. If any gamer friends you have are deeply religious and not open minded they may want to overlook this lol. The graphics on this game are excellent. The environment really takes a great part in the game as you climb view points to survey the area. Climbing those tall buildings doesn't seem such a hassle when you have such a great view to look at when you reach the top. The character models have a nice finish with average npcs looking a little less detailed then main characters which is easily overlooked. The game plays real well and you can chose whether to be sneaky or just straight forward slashing through everyone. Oddly enough both tactics are fun in there own way. It is also easy to find your own style of play for this considering there is difficulty in both tactics. The downfall to this game is it's repetitiveness. After you have done your first assignment you pretty much have played the core of the entire game. Of course as you progress you will gain new weapons and abilitys which make the game playable and combining this with a great story will keep you going throughout the entire game.]]>
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[********************WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!***************************I have to say...AC was a good game, but I cant give it a better score than this. It tells a good story, but repetition settles in early.Story: 5/5Without a doubt, the game has an amazing story that mixes real history, with fiction. (Im sort of a medieval history buff so i understood A LOT) The game takes place in 1191 AD during the Third Crusade and September 2012 (Present day). The game has you in control of Desmond Miles, an Arabic bartender who is the ancestor of the legendary assassin Altaïr ibn La-Ahad (rough translation to English=""The Flying One, Son of None, Arabic=الطائر ابن لا أحد), a member of the Hashshashin (translation to English=""The Assassin Brotherhood""). You serve the Brotherhood's leader Al Mualim. He asks you to kill 9 leading members of the Order of the Knights Templar (in the beginning you have no idea they are member of the order) who all know the location of the Piece of Eden, a powerful weapon that can be used to control the and memories of humans, sort of like mass hypnosis. Al Mualim (who is also a member of the Templars) is using you to find the location so he can use it for himself and conquer the Middle East. When he locates it, he tries to use it to alter Altaïr's sight Desmond Miles is being used by a corporation known as Abstergo, who are using his genetic memory, and a machine known as the Animus, to find the location of the Piece of Eden and the other pieces displayed in Altaïr's memory. When he is fully synchronized with Altaïr's memory, he is of no use to Abstergo (the Templars) and is to be killed. A researcher named Lucy Stillman saves you by telling the scientist that gave the order, that Desmond is still of use. (She says this as she makes a signal with her hand to show that she is an Assassin, the closed ring finger as if it were removed) and you are free. You now have the power of Eagle Vision. When using it, you see hidden messages on the floor and on the walls. All of them referencing to cataclysmic-grade events such as December 21, 2012 (which is also the date that the Templars plan to launch a satellite that will ""end the war forever""), Revelation 22:13 (""I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."") and other important references to the end of the world in other religions. Also you can read the email of the scientist detailing the failed recovery of one other Piece of Eden and other unnamed artifacts, all resulting in disastrous accidents, including the Philadelphia Experiment and the Tunguska event. There is also one about the Holy Grail. Truly a great story with lots of hidden references.Graphics: 4.5/10The game looks great. Just great. However, on occasion, there is texture pop-in, not such a great draw distance, and sometimes AI characters get stuck on pathing maps or clip into buildings. That's not a reason to say the graphics are bad though.Sound: Not too sure, maybe a 4.5?Its been a while since i played this, so im not too sure about the soundtrack. Voice acting is good and not too over-dramatic. Characters will have little comments when you do acrobatic feats in public such as ""Is he crazy?"", or ""If he falls, I'm not helping him."". All of the targets are voiced well also. Altaïr barely speaks, but when he does, his voice is perfect and the mysterious tone fits him well.Gameplay: 3/10This is where the game tries too hard and somewhat fails. While the game does have good gameplay moments (namely random knife kills, assassinations, running away, performing crazy acrobatics, etc.) However, the combat and mission structure is just too damn repetitive. After the little tutorial-esque beginning, you begin by exploring the Kingdom, the overworld of AC. The Kingdom is definitely the games largest area. The other areas are the cities of Masyaf, Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus. The Kingdom is quite auxiliary though, due to the fact that you can warp directly to the other cities once you've already been there. The only real reason to go back there after the third time is to get the flags, viewpoints and Templar Knights. Then once you are in town after sneaking through the guardhouse as a scholar, you are FORCED to gather information on the target. This involves mini-missions located throughout town. At first, you must scale the View Points (giant buildings) to further detail the map and mission locations. The missions include saving townspeople, interrogation, pick-pocketing, listening in on conversations and other assassin things. The PC version adds new mission types, but you need an uber, god PC to run it so im not sure what the new ones are. The first 3 targets require you to do 3 missions, while everything else requires 4. After you gather info, you go to the Assassin's Bureau to get your target. You locate him, kill him, and run. Then you listen to a speech from Al Mualim, get a new ability, rinse and repeat 9 times.This isn't so bad until about the 4th time and then you start getting really really bored of it. The combat doesnt help the situation either. At the beginning you are just button-mashing square until they all die. Once you get counters and throw breaks, you just time the buttons and it becomes a ""line em' up and knock em' down"" game. Way too easy.Value: 2/10Unfortunately, the game features no endgame bonuses (besides not having to adhere to the traditions of the Creed, i.e. not killing innocents) and no challenge mode. The only thing you can do is look at the little text references and replay old levels.Final Verdict:The game looks great, sounds great, and tells an amazing story. But with no replay value, gameplay that is repetitive and lackluster combat, AC is not all it can be.Final Score: 3.5/5]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[This game,has been talked about a lot before it was released.As usual, the proud PC owners got it after the console owners because the world seems to run around like this nowadays ... nevertheless I expected much,i say, from this game and Ubisoft ( and the guys from Ubi Romania ) did a great job...I can proudly affirm that this game is one of the best games i played... now let's see why...  Graphics are an important part of videogames nowadays... in fact if game X has less shaders than game Y,the graphics aren't as good as they should be... well Assasin's Creed may not use CryEngine (thank god) but it's graphics are simply amazing... Everything looks so alive.. from Altair to the madmen in the cities and to the cities themselves.... The (3) cities you are sent to ""visit"" are masterpieces of gaming architecture.... they respect the architecture of the time, having specific elements... as an example.. where the muslim towns had round-ish shapes, and that exotic look, the crusader towns came in with a more serious look... the buildings structure giving them a solid look a ""rectangular"" shape if you will , making you feel different each time you travelled from Jerusalem to Acre..... the citizens look very alive , as does Altair and his assasination targets.....but with all these strong points , come the bugs you can find (like people stretching unnaturally when falling from buildings, stretched people appearing in the sky.. etc )   VERDICT - 9  The Sound fits in and helps with creating the atmosphere of the time... the voices of the citizens are good, the voice acting of the main characters is ok, but doesn't get the spotlight (though Altair has a convincing voice in all what he says ) ... the music during chases is very good .. helping the adrenaline get to you faster ...   VERDICT - 9  The Gameplay is what this game has the best .... As you know it is a platformer with combat and stealth elements.. usually you would say ""bah... another PoP like game.. boring"" but it brings some innovative ideas into the so-called ""PoP gameplay"" I'm going to start with the best part of the gameplay, and that is the platforming part.... in other platformers you only needed to jump over gaps and obstacles or catch certain ledges in order to move further.. In Assasin's Creed you any small piece or crack in a building can help you get to your goal.. this brings fun to the game because you can literally stay off the streets and on top of the buildings all the time ...  The goal in the game is to assasinate 9 targets ... to get to them you must investigate to find information about the time and place which would favor your strike.. now this is probably the weakest part of the gameplay ... because there are 6 (entertaining) minigames you can choose from.. 3 being the minimum limit of investigations needed to allow you to start the assasination mission.... Though most of the times you'll be performing stealth kills at certain points (after assasinations or because of some dumb mistake your keyboard or gamepad made you do..) you will find yourself exposed... now in order to become anonymous again you can run and hide in certain hiding spots (hay carts, hay packs , between 2 seated citizens on a bench, in a special thing on top of the buildings ) , or kill all the guards chasing you ) .. and here we come to the most controversial part of the game.. the combat... at first sight it will seem boring but when you get the counter attack you will see that repetitivity is fun for the first time ever .. Apart from the times you'll be running errands to get the informaion needed you'll just feel like climbing buildings or walking... and you'll see that Altair moves so naturally ... I mean the movement synchronizes with what directions he goes, what moves he needs to do... putting the body in the real positions neede for some actions.....  So this is the main reason why Assasin's Creed is a must have  VERDICT - 9  The story starts off pretty weird (in a high tech research facility) but as you play on you'll see that it fits to the gameplay and vice versa... I won't give further information , because there might be SPOILERS..... it's not bad but it's not the best , either  VERDICT - 7  The overall impression the game left me was one of freedom... one that gets near to reality.... that i was visiting a living world that i was taking part in everything...that no one could stop me from (killing the nearest peasant then running like a phuxtard around with 20 guards after me) doing what i want ...  VERDICT - 10  So this sums up my opinion and impression on Assasin's Creed... if you haven't got it.. get it now... or at least rent it.. because you'll be missing out one of the best games that ever came out ..]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[In the gaming world there are a couple of different game types that you will notice. There are games that have some of the most mediocre graphics of its time but deliver in every other category. Then there are the games that have gorgeous visuals but seem to fail in one or more of the other categories. Assassin's Creed resembles the likes of the latter. That doesn't mean that the game isn't worth playing, because it is.The story isn't as mind blowing as Ubisoft probably hoped it would be – with all that cover up and such that they did for so long. Basically it's modern day, and a medical corporation that has found out how to recover your ancestor's memories through the use of your DNA has abducted you. All they need to do, and demand you do so, is to slap you on what is called an Animus. The Animus is what allows you to live out your ancestor's memories, and thus make the game possible. From there you take the role of Altair – an assassin that lived during the time of the Crusades (roughly the year 1191). From the start of the game you are stripped of your rank and weaponry after a mission goes awry, and you are forced to assassinate nine men to recover the respect of your peers, your rank, and of course your weapons. In between the odd killing you will be brought back to the present and control Desmond long enough to walk to a bed and sleep (everyone needs sleep, even the distant relative of assassins). However, you will spend the vast majority of your time in the shoes of Altair. You will go on a journey that gets repetitive quickly as you go collect information in the same ways (eavesdropping, interrogation, pick pocketing, informants) every time before getting permission from the local Assassin's Bureau to actually kill one of the nine. You can also save some citizens from the guards, and in return you will be aided in the form of thugs, which hold the guards at bay the next time you're running from them and are in the area. All of these things are made easier to find by getting to high points in the cities. See that eagle in the sky? Go climb that building that it's flying around and have a look around before you go on your information hunting – it makes life easy. Oh, and you also get to jump off said buildings into conveniently placed piles of hay (if you ask me, no amount of hay will stop your body after dropping nine stories but that's just me).Since we are dealing with the times of the Crusades, you will be spending a lot of time in the Middle East. Specifically, you will be enjoying the sights that Damascus, Jerusalem, and Acre. Masyaf is also in there, but is basically your hub of operations – the location of the Assassin's Guild. In between each of the towns you will travel through what is called the Kingdom which is basically just the world outside of the towns with predefined paths that allow you to get from place to place without much confusion via horseback. It is of course quite obvious from the get-go that Assassin's Creed is a great looking game. With the time period it's set in, the developers had some serious work ahead of them since the architecture of the period can get quite intricate. They did an awesome job though, and in the end, made one of the better-looking games of 2007. The buildings are spot on, the lighting is fantastic, and the character models are also very well done. You can, however, tell that this is an Ubisoft developed game when you take notice of the gestures of the NPCs. For some reason, a lot of games published by Ubisoft tend to take superfluous hand gestures to the next level. This is fine though as it only shows up in the NPCs that are least important – those who have any actual significance are a little more toned down and realistic in their movements. When you take in the art direction, the technical prowess and the two melded together, you have one truly magnificent looking game. The only hitch in the graphical department is the odd time you will see some harsh clipping. This usually only happens when fighting close to buildings and isn't noticeable otherwise.Assassin's Creed is, for obvious reasons, heavily reliant on its combat and movement around the places you will be gracing your presence with, and for the most part they nailed it. The big selling point of the game from the time the first trailer was shown was the ability of Altair to be the ancient version of Spider Man, sans web slinging. This is the heart of the game, and is what makes it as fun as it can be. The controls are the perfect combination of interaction and autopilot for what feats you will be pulling off. For what it's worth, this portion of the game will never really get old. Running from the 5-0 of the 12th century has never been so thrilling. Of course, when you do on occasion get stuck in a corner, or just feel like committing acts of guard genocide, being able to use a blade or two is a good idea. The combat system is well mapped to the controller and won't get you too confused when you're in the fray. In the beginning you don't have any special attacks to help you out but by the middle of the game you will have an arsenal of moves under your belt. The most useful of these is the counter attack. The problem is, it makes the game a tad too easy. If you have even the slightest bit of timing in you, wiping hordes of enemies from existence is a cakewalk. When you first see the achievement for winning 100 battles in a row your first reaction is probably going to be ""Holy #@%$ !"" but then when you get the counter attack ability you will randomly see the achievement pop up. Again, your response will probably be ""Holy #@%$ !"" Luckily though, the animations that come out of the special attacks are all brutal and completely awesome to watch over and over again. If you get bored seeing Altair chop a guy in the neck and then remove his sword by kneeing the person in the face… well you're obviously not hip or with it.The downside other than the ease of combat is how Ubisoft set up the difficulty curve. You will blissfully walk through the entire game until you land yourself in the middle of the last two missions and ending sequences of the game. Normally you would figure a game would get progressively harder – this is not the case with Assassin's Creed. I can see it now, the meeting of the minds, and someone says, ""You know, wouldn't it make life easier on us if we just threw in more drunks and beggars in the street…oh and make random guards God-like?"" Nothing will cause an ulcer to grow faster than walking down a street and seeing a drunk or two walking towards you. It will cause such illness due to noticing them not pay attention to anybody…until they see you. Then their eyes almost explode as they start rambling on and move towards you. In a fit of uber-drunkness, they then push you violently for no reason. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't always right in the middle of a group of guards, which you inevitably hit and then have to wade through with your blade. Of course, the beggars only get in your way, which again – not so bad, but they are the only people you cannot brush off with the B button…Speaking of those beggars, if it isn't the path blocking that annoys you, it will be their voices and repetitive dialogue. It would have been nice to see some diversity in the voice acting for the citizens of each town, but apparently everyone has one of three voices pitches due to what seems to either be inbreeding or a bad throat infection. When you have hundreds of NPCs around you, all spewing the same lines and in the same voice, it really nags at you and makes you wonder why they couldn't have mixed it up a bit more. Luckily, the important characters have great voice acting behind them, and lends to the story very well. Altair has a couple of weak moments where the voice acting is poor, but on the whole, it's done very well.As for the rest of the audio department, well, it's average. The music won't get you very hyped or on edge during the times you would hope it to…say, like when you're about to take someone's life. The sound effects are pretty solid though, and do a great job of making you believe you did in fact just slice the back of that dudes knee.In the end, Assassin's Creed is a slightly above average gameplay experience wrapped in a very pretty package. The monotony of the missions and side quests will be ever so slightly enhanced by the exploration experience and cool battle animations. Unfortunately, some annoyances toward the end that ultimately lead up to a disappointing conclusion might leave a slightly bitter taste in your mouth (In the end, it all comes down to seeming like an altered version of ""The Da Vinci Code.""). You will more than likely not play the game more than once through, and if you have the gumption to go and collect the plethora of flags that they have set before you for extended play, then you probably have more patience than most people. There doesn't seem to be much room for Xbox Live downloadable content expansion, and so you will probably have to patiently wait for Assassin's Creed 2 to get any more of your Creed on. Unless you will die without having an action/adventure game in your collection, the better choice would be to rent Assassin's Creed.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I remember last fall, the colors on the trees, everybody going ape-shit over this Halo 3 game that looked only a little better than Halo 2 did but had 4-player co-op which was the appeal of the original even though Perfect Dark on the N64 had a two player co-op but only with the RAM expansion which was included in Donkey Kong 64 but more necessary for a game made by this company Factor Five that had to do with Star Wars and I remembered the commercials for this game that I'm writing the review for and how awesome it looked.  It was like you got to control a ninja, because let's face it, the Tenchu games don't really give you that feeling nor has Ninja Gaiden ever presented a realistic depiction of one.  So you get to control this ninja, except he's wearing all white and in the Middle East and he invented parkour and that impression from the adverts got me interested in the game which if you haven't played or heard the plot then stop reading now.Giddy like a school girl, I bought the game the day it came out and popped it in the 360.  Right away, these cool little bleeps of molecule structures appear with the title so you know something's up. Oh, and the intro video is pretty bad-ass. The game makes a good first impression.After some initial play and tutorials to introduce you to the expressive mechanic system (low action and high action), you find out that the white Ninja is called Altair and he's a talented sneaky death dealer that knows his bad-assness like a hot girl who knows she's hot and his gang (the Assassin's Guild) is fighting this other gang (the Knights Templar) for control of a space artifact that warps people's minds to the user of said space artifact. And then you learn that you're just some little bitch named Desmond and you're in this machine called the Animus (a byzantine Christian reference) and that Altair is your ancestor and you are reliving his memories because they are locked in your DNA and that the A-cap at the end of a single DNA strand is tangentally related to the aging and breakdown of eukaryotic cells and the Animus makes this happen. Science help us! and that run-on sentence. After you wrap your head around that bit of awful sci-fi and the mind dump that is Desmond (I'm just a bartender), who didn't inherit a single awesome thing from his ancestor, you meet the evil scientist and his hot and caring assistant and they either throw you in your room or stick you in the Animus.And here is where the new set of video game cliches kick in. Having violated the Creed (Assassin's not Apollo), you lose all your super awesome abilities and are now just kind of awesome, which happened in God of War 2, Devil May Cries and countless other games. Oh, and that life bar is your synch bar, how in-sync you are with your DNA memories. But, you do have the coolest switch-blade ever. Ever.The free-running is a lot of fun and the jumping off of buildings into the conveniently placed hay in the three major cities looks good. The cinematic deaths are well done as well and the entire game looks really good. So why the low score?The game moves really slowly. You are moving at a snail's pace most of the time through your nine main missions because if you just walk the wrong way, guards are going to chase you. And you want to run away since the Prince of Persia style combat does not suit this game what-so-ever. You stand and block for two minutes and hope to counter kill or parry kill so you don't keep hacking at the same guard and sometimes these don't trigger and god the combat is mediocre for a Middle-East white ninja assassin.  So you walk around looking like you're praying and praying that you could just go a little faster.  And then the mini-missions. These get progressively worse. There's the collect all the flags in such and such time where in the last set there's 50 flags and two minutes or some bullshit. There's the eavesdropping and beating up where they throw the crazy drunks around to make it harder. I really liked the assassin mini- missions but then the timers appeared, the lamest way ever to increase difficulty. And this is the meat of the game. The mini-missions are the same from hit to hit and don't feel more difficult, only cheaper and uninspired. Oh yeah, the white ninja parkour guy can't swim. Lame. The actual assassinations are really fun with variety and originality and if you didn't have to go through the terrible mini-missions to get to them they would be even more enjoyable. I guess Ubisoft was going for the Hot Girl with Ugly Friend approach to where the ugly friend serves to make the hot girl look hotter. The mental Hospital one was my favorite. But after you kill one of these guys, who are usually surrounded by guards, they talk to you for 5 minutes, while you're still surrounded by guards. Must be some cultural thing back then over there, where the person who killed another gets 5 minutes to hear the person's last words about how they're making the world better. And then you're zapped back to the guild while you listen to the guild-master talk and you're allowed to walk around while waiting that out, which is pointless and just seems like a missed detail.Just to go over the mandatory things. Graphics are great even if the cities have parts that look repetitive and the cinematic deaths are almost worth giving this thing a 3 for. Gameplay is good in theory, poor in execution with pacing issues do to the stealth system, but the parkour is well done with a few problems of path determination. The beggars are so f***ing annoying, just like real-life bums, and all the beggars say the same thing and they don't go away, which I guess simulates the real world pretty well. So if you want the harassment experience of a bum but in a video game, Ass Ass got you covered.  The music is okay with a decent arc to match gameplay, even though I turned it down in the audio because the sound effects were pretty sweet, especially the ones for the switchblade wrist blade. The voice acting is decent if stereotyped for each character that matters and Altair could sound more hard and bad-ass than he does. Achievements include: jump off all the towers with the eagles, kill all the Templars, find all the flags for each set of maps, and various combat ones you'll receive anyways. Finding these flags, waste of time, not enough points.So, be prepared to have fun for about four hours or so with this game, and then you just  have to struggle the rest of the way to the weird ending which is completely sci-fi and doesn't mesh well with the Holy Land setting. It could be worse. The gameplay could suck as bad as Mass Effect's does. That gameplay is diarrhea compared to the silent-but-deadlies this game exudes. But if you like climbing things and jumping off of stuff and the most realistic bum simulation seen yet in video games, Ass Ass is for you.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Without a doubt, Assassin’s Creed has been one of the most hyped games for the past year. Now that it is finally out, the question on the minds of those who have yet to play it is, “was it worth the wait”? Well, it is a good game with a beautiful presentation, but there still is much to be desired.If you’ve been hiding under a rock then the odds are you know very little about Assassin’s Creed – otherwise you probably have a general idea of what it is all about. Basically, it is a stealth action game in which you take the role of an assassin called Altair. It is set during the Crusades, so combat consists mainly of sword fighting. You also have the opportunity to quickly and quietly put someone down with a retractable blade that is positioned on your wrist. There is a pretty major twist to the whole story, which I will refrain from saying in case you are unaware at this point. Oddly enough, you find out this major story telling element as soon as you start playing, which seems a bit odd, considering how much better it could have made the game if the designers didn’t reveal the secret to you until you were done playing. Anyhow, the story in Assassin’s Creed is pretty well done, although there are a few questionable elements which may have worked better if they were tackled in different ways and at different times.One of the nicest feelings you get out of playing Assassin’s Creed is the sheer scope of your mobility. You can climb every building you see, virtually as high as you can see and you can move nearly everywhere you see. One major exception to this otherwise open-movement philosophy is the lack of mobility in water. How assassins are incapable of swimming is absolutely well beyond me! It is a horrible decision that was made because it completely contradicts the essence of free movement. Fortunately, there is very little water in the game, so it is only going to get on your nerves for a brief period of time.Most of the time, you will want to do your dirty work incognito. There are many ways to act covert, even if this is the feudal ages. You can blend in with scholars by gesturing your hands in the prayer position, sit on a bench, and you can roll in a nice pile of hay. Of course, hay is located all around the game, and it always tends to be conveniently located in places you’ll need it. Instead of taking care of your immediate objectives right of the bat (each of your assassinations), you need to spend a good deal of time – in fact most of the time – gathering information before you strike. If you need a simple metaphor to help you visualize how this game takes place, just think: Tenchu meets the Crusades.Of course, Assassin’s Creed plays quite a bit differently than Tenchu, and is leaps and bounds ahead in terms of graphics. There’s almost no debate - the most attractive feature of Assassin’s Creed are its breathtaking visuals. This amazing visual monument contains some of the most stunning graphics ever seen on any platform - from highly detailed, and authentic looking settings, to fluid looking cloth animations (for the most part). Altair wears a fluid and nearly life-like outfit that flows with movement, and flags throughout the kingdom ripple in the wind as one would expect in the real world. Enemies even twitch and spasm, as they are lying on the ground before death’s sweet embrace. The world of Assassin’s Creed is painted beautifully with high resolution textures, and nearly everything looks spectacular. Well, that is with the exception of water – once again water is not the high point of Assassin’s Creed, as it is quite dull and stagnant looking. Aside from that, everything is animated superbly, and the tremendous amount of attention to detail is remarkable.The character models are all sculpted with a strong sense of style and polish, and clearly represent the era and region they derive from. Surprisingly, lip synchronization is also well done, with a few less common exceptions. There are thousands upon thousands of NPCs throughout the kingdom, though realistically, most are only there for show and to make escaping through the streets more of a challenge. Far fewer actually have any real importance in the game, though every person walking the streets enhances the environment, even if they are not as finely detailed as the more significant figures you encounter. Needless to say, it is quite obvious that much more attention has been paid to the design of Altair, than any of the other characters in the game. Those who have roles in the main story also look considerably better than the masses you encounter on the streets, but still are nowhere near as sleek and polished as Altair.Nonetheless, there are hordes of civilians spread throughout each of the main three cities, Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem, which really gives you a sense of the size and life of such thriving outposts of civilization. It’s a nice change to see so much life in capital cities, since many games tend to throw in a scarce number of citizens and want you to believe the city is a booming metropolis. In Assassin’s Creed, you actually get the sense of the scale of these regions, and just how lively many ancient communities were.Each of the three cities is broken into three separate districts, rich, poor and middle, although I often found myself having a hard time distinguishing between each. I was a bit surprised to see roughly the same looking people and similar looking buildings throughout all of the districts. Several times I couldn’t help but thinking that the variations between the classes were miniscule at most, as I would expect to see much more of a contrast between the architecture of the rich and poor districts. Sadly, there didn’t seem to be that distinction, and if distinction is there it is so negligible you may not even notice it.My biggest gripe is that there are so few variations among the NPCs walking the streets. The developers created roughly 10-20 different character models for civilians (for each city) and “copied and pasted” those everywhere, which means when you turn the corner you may run into a guy you just saw seconds ago. Even worse are the more rare occasions in which you can see two characters, which look absolutely identical, conversing with one another! More variety with the appearance of the citizens would have greatly increased the level of realism and allowed for the player to more easily assimilate into this virtual world. It’s a bit hard to take your surroundings seriously when you are seeing the same people everywhere. Though, in all fairness, this has often been a problem with even the most highly regarded games - a sad sight this gamer has hoped developers would have overcome by now.Fortunately, Assassin’s Creed boasts the most professional motion capturing and choreography ever seen in gaming, which rivals even the best Hollywood has to offer. Every swing of a blade, or punch in the gut is amazingly integrated into the most fluid and realistic movement I have ever seen in a game. And, as you climb atop builds to escape, every reach actually grasps onto a small object or crevice in the structure – a feat very few other games take the time to orchestrate realistically.While not as much of a feast for the senses, the sounds are not half-bad. The music features a variety of middle-eastern sounds which fit the theme perfectly. As things heat up, the music becomes much more intense letting you know you’re in a battle – in case you didn’t get the clue by the guards hacking away at you for some reason. The sound of swords clashing is awesome, and it even varies so you aren’t hearing the same sound clip over and over for each clash of metal. The voice acting is generally pretty well done, though sometimes only mediocre. It’s a pity that everyone seems to emit an accent except for our protagonist, Altair. A more serious problem with the voice-overs is that you end up hearing the same one-liners repeatedly, which can really begin to get on your nerves. But at least something is present and they don’t just stare you in the face. I found myself often feeling that the game was missing ambience and sounds to create the feeling of being in one of these cities. With so many people and markets everywhere, you rarely hear people talking (for how many there are) and you don’t get the sensation of all the hustle and bustle around you. With so much liveliness surrounding you, it should only be expected that sounds envelope you from all the commotion of busy urban life. Since there is so much to see, you naturally only come to expect to hear just as much.And much to see their definitely is. The line of sight is incredible, especially when you scale to one of the many view points throughout the Kingdom. When you get to the top of a view point and swan dive downward towards a pile of hay - it’s definitely a sight to see. Some of the views are breathtaking, although there does tend to be occasional slow down and tearing from time to time. Oddly enough, the slow down seems to come at almost random times and not necessarily just because you are up high looking throughout the city. Screen tearing, while also sporadic, occurs almost twice as often as frame rate lag, although neither of these are to the point that they really interfere with game play. The camera can also be a bit of a booger occasionally, and it always seems to cause problems during combat. An object may obstruct your view by being present in the foreground and anything behind it, including you or your enemies, will become hidden. It doesn’t happen very often, but I did find myself cursing at the camera at least a few times.Combat is incredibly intense and fairly balanced too, I might add. When you start off the game, and your health is at a minimum, you run the risk of being killed almost as much as the chances of you killing. Obviously, once you get a hang of how the combat works, things will start to shape up in your favor. I never would have imagined, but I absolutely love the combat in Assassin’s Creed, because it not only is a well balanced composition of skill, timing and patience, but because of how well orchestrated every swing and blow is. If you are impatient you may not like Assassin’s Creed too much, because this is not a button-smasher. You need to time all your moves out properly and think before you act, otherwise, you are not going to be too happy with the consequence. There is a considerably large emphasis on timing and pace in the battles that you will encounter, and if you can’t keep that it mind and can’t wait for the right times to strike you will be one of the corpses lying on the ground people are freaking out over.I welcome the combat system, because of how finely tuned it was towards practicing timing and rhythm. It’s nice to play a game where you can’t just hopelessly smash down all the buttons hoping to win. I have to admit, when I first played Assassin’s Creed, I was pretty bad, but towards the end of the game I could take on 20 or more guards while taking only a scratch. In other words: practice makes perfect! Unlike other action, and even role playing, games that guide the skill balance based on handicaps (the AI’s attack power, speed, etc), Assassin’s Creed seems to only increase the number of foes you have to deal with, which is a much more welcome direction than pitting you against ridiculously difficult enemies. Unless you are a train wreck when it comes to playing games, your skill should increase as you play, so an increased number of enemies as you progress is not a big deal.Of course, occasionally, there may be more guards than you can deal with, or you simply may not be up for a fight. Whatever the reason might be; if you need to get away from your pursuers be prepared for an amazing getaway. If you have seen Assassin’s Creed in action, you were probably impressed with how awesome looking and incredibly intense the chase scenes are. You do your best to climb to the highest point you can, while guards are throwing rocks to knock you down. If you do manage to get on top of a structure and loose your followers then you better find a hiding place quickly, because they are sure to follow you up.One odd, and downright unrealistic, quirk about escaping is that when you do manage to find camouflage, as soon as your status becomes “anonymous” again, any guards that could have been feet away from you seconds ago become completely oblivious to you when they see you seconds later. It’s a bit too easy in that camouflage not only restores your status to being another face in the crowd, but it apparently induces amnesia upon all your recent pursuers. Without the ability to remember who they were even chasing seconds earlier, the AI of the guards could use a bit more work. I also found it amusing to stand next to the top of a ladder and wait for the guards to climb up and I’d slice them down – and of course, since they aren’t the brightest bunch, they will continue to keep re-climbing the ladder until I sliced them all to death.Generally, the control is not only simple but very efficient, but there are times when it just does something completely different than you had intended. You would think that to scale so many large structures and jump from poles and so forth that a lot of work would be involved in pulling off those feats. That couldn’t be any less true – all you really need to do is hold down the R2 and A buttons and you will be running wherever you go and climbing anything in front of you or jumping over any gaps in your direction. It’s actually a very simple system that still lets you feel like you are controlling the character, but also takes care of most of the dirty precision work. Of course, it’s not perfect, and there are bound to be times which Altair does something different than you intend or expect, but it is never anything major like jumping off somewhere or killing himself. Instead, occasionally he may try climbing up a structure or jumping on something when you just want to sit on a bench or hide under shelter. Assassin’s Creed also contains an auto-lock-on mechanism that will automatically have your aim locked on the closest enemy when you enter combat. It works very well, and is incredibly helpful, but there are occasions in which you don’t want the lock-on enabled at all because you are trying to escape.There are some fundamental problems with the formula of Assassin’s Creed – primarily which it suffers from a high dose of repetition. You have your assassinations, and then you have to gather information prior to introducing Mr. Steel to Mr. Badguy. The gathering information part is where it all gets bland and overly done as the game goes on. To gather information, you do different things like sit on benches and eavesdrop on people, pickpocket others and perform hits on the side to gather knowledge from a couple brotherhood buddies of Altair. The problem is that for every assassination you make, you need to repeat these same preparatory steps over and over again. And since you spend much more time doing the information gathering than assassinating, this means you are spending more time doing the same thing over and over again as opposed to something new.No one wants to do the same thing over and over no matter what it is – unless it is pleasurable. And not too many people are going to think it’s that interesting or entertaining to sit on benches listening to people, or walking behind a guy and holding a button - especially when pickpocketing is so overly simplified and without consequence. To pickpocket, you walk behind your victim and hold the A button – that’s it. Very rarely they may turn around and you’re busted, but all that happens then is they might alert the guards and you just have to leave the general area and come back again to give it another try. There is also no penalty for being spotted by anyone else as you are doing it, which feels a bit off for a stealth game. Other forms of information gathering consist of making a hit on some other guards as a favor to a friend, or collecting a certain number of flags – both objectives which are timed. It seems odd that some of these information gathering objectives have 3 or 5 minute limits, as they seem to be nothing more than mini-games and oddly out of place in a stealth game. Once more, if you fail any of these, you can come back and try them again. You don’t have to gather all the information that exists prior to an assignation, but at least half it. No matter what you do to get that information, you are sure to repeat many of the same steps numerous times for each new assassination you get. Sure, it is understandable that a game can have such elements, but the entire formula of a game shouldn’t revolve around them, as is the case here.Sadly, Assassin’s Creed feels to be all about repetition. Even all of the achievements are awarded for performing a certain task or skill so many times. There are things you can do on the side of the main quest’s assassinations, but these too consist of pure repetition. There are many flags spread throughout the game in each of the areas, and if you go hunting for them you will be rewarded with achievements. Throughout each district of each of the three cities, there are citizens in distress, being harassed by guards. Saving all of them for each city also will earn you achievements. Saving each citizen is done by taking down the surrounding guards and then talking to them – once you have done it a single time doing it again will be simply since nothing changes. Even more disappointingly, the dialog they say is incredibly repetitive and you will hear the same few lines countless times if you go on these freeing “missions”. Personally, I feet that Assassin’s Creed would benefit with the addition of some real side-missions with unique objectives. Everything you do in the main quest is already repetitive, and then everything you can do on the side is repetitive, so there should have at least be some missions to break the monotony by sending you on more original missions. It isn’t by any means a complete bore to play, but occasionally you may get the feeling of your routine being somewhat tiresome.Presentation wise, there is also a bit to be desired. It does not look as if they developers took much time or effort in porting Assassin’s Creed to the Xbox 360. The tearing and frame rate problems appear to be completely random and come at sporadic times, which is a good indication that it isn’t necessarily the result of over-processing. While it is true that a huge percentage of Xbox 360 games suffer from screen-tearing, there are also a large number of huge games with awesome graphics that get away with just as much without suffering from these problems. Sadly, I also encountered collision-detection bugs on two separate occasions, which resulted in me having to restart the game. Once I had got stuck inside a tree somehow and could not move. The other time was towards the end of the game when the area accessible to you gradually moves as you defeat soldiers. Somehow, I got stuck inside a no-access area and Altair was running into a wall and I could not regain control of him. It seems as though either the developers didn’t scrutinize the performance of the game well enough, or problems were created out of the port. Whatever the case, I encountered two fatal bugs while playing, so I can only hope you will be luckier than I. But aside from these two flukes and the occasional issue with tearing and frame rates, the game runs quite well - especially considering how much is on-screen at a single time. Assassin’s creed will never come screeching to halt and completely dip in frame rate as the occasional lag you will encounter is relatively minor.Even if much of the game play can feel repetitive, it still feels enjoyable to climb up buildings and throw beggars around. Combat is also a blast, and if you are one of those collector types, then you will end up spending a long time trying to find all the hidden flags. Sometimes you just feel like picking something up and messing around in it for a while – Assassin’s Creed is perfect for that. Even with the problems that it has, it is one of the most beautiful looking games ever, and I honestly was quite addicted to playing it for a good few days. Yes, there is a lot that could be improved upon, but very few games are perfect as they are. If you have a general idea about what you are getting into when you play a game like this, then I am quite confident that you will not be disappointed.Overall Score: 8Gameplay: (8) A good story, with some questionable story telling decisions. Climb almost anywhere and go almost anywhere - just don't forget H20 is instant death (assassin's can't swim). Enjoyable combat and a wonder to watch. Too bad it's formula is based around repetition. Unmatched motion capturing & choreography!Graphics: (9) Quite possibly the nicest looking game in many ways. If it weren't for dips in the frame-rate and tearing, it would be close to perfection.Sound: (8) Some great sound affects mixed with good music and voice overs. It's a pity so many lines are recycled as often as they are and that ambience feels lacking overall.Lasting Appeal: (7) Repetition. It's always a blast to scale the cities, but the formula begins to feel repetitive after you are on your second hit. A variety of side missions would be greatly welcomed.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The highly anticipated Assassin's Creed has enjoyed massive sales but mixed reviews amongst critics and consumers alike. While my score implies the following review will be positive, let me start by saying many of the negative reviews are justifiable. However, I have found that the positive qualities of Assassin's Creed do much to compensate for the obvious flaws. Overall, I found Assassin's Creed to be a wonderful and innovative game, which, for several unfortunate reasons, fell just short of the ""epic masterpiece"" status Ubisoft Montreal promised.For those familiar with the story, please skip this paragraph to get to my review. In a sincere effort to avoid spoilers of any kind, I will be as vaguely specific as possible, if that makes any sense. The main character in AC is Altair, a 12th century member of the Assassin brotherhood who has been charged by the master of the assassins to eliminate specific targets in an effort to halt the Third Crusade. As your body count increases, so does the mystery surrounding the intentions of, both, your targets and your master. You will spend the majority of your time in three ancient Middle Eastern cities: Damascus, Jerusalem, and Acre. You begin the game in your home city of Masyaf, to which you will return after each assassination. These cities are linked by a large grouping of thoroughfares and villages referred to as the Kingdom, which you can choose to traverse at speed on horseback. I found the story to be somewhat predictable after the rather major twist, which happens to come at the very beginning of the game, but the premise was interesting enough to help keep my sixaxis embedded in my palms until it was over.The gameplay is a wildly entertaining and intuitive fusion of platforming, creative problem solving, stealth, and tactical timing-based sword play. Controlling Altair may seem complicated at first glance, but the system is effective and easy to learn. Basically, the face buttons are assigned to four parts of Altair's body: triangle (/\) for his head; square ([ ]) for his weapon hand; circle (O) for his empty hand; X (uh, X) for his feet. For example, hit /\ to go into a first person viewpoint to scan your surroundings for enemies or targets. Hit [ ] to attack. If you're on the verge of having your cover blown (as indicated by a flashing red symbol and a persistent beep) hold down X to slow your pace and blend in with the crowd. Hold O to use your open hand to gently push your way through crowded areas.Altair defaults to a low profile action set, which is basically a very deliberate lurch, as you move him around the city with the left analog stick. However, to perform the much touted ""free running"" (also known as parkour, an alternative sport which originated in France several years ago) you must hold down R1 to go into high profile mode. This makes Altair much more noticeable, but lets him run faster and clear smaller obstacles such as crates and low walls. The really cool stuff requires that you also hold X while in high profile. This causes Altair to sprint on straight paths, and automatically leap across gaps in the rooftops, hop from rafter to rafter, climb walls, etc. Much ado has been made of the free running aspect of the game, and for good reason. In an effort to keep you immersed in the game world, much of the specific control of Altair has been taken out of your hands to achieve a fluidity of motion that would otherwise have been impossible to attain. The cities are very vertical in construction, with posts, bricks, windows, ledges, and more protruding from nearly every surface, just begging you to climb, and it would have been frustrating to have to control every hand and foot movement to scale a wall. While simple in control, you will quickly fall in love with the incredible animations as his hands and feet realistically reach for every protrusion, or as he soars off of a roof and grasps onto a ledge across a 20ft gap, swaying from the momentum. It's all thrilling stuff, and it honestly never got old over my estimated 20 hours of play time.What will get old after about four hours of play time is the repetitive nature of the mission structure. Every one of your missions must be approached in the same way. Before you perform an assassination, you must gather information on your targets' location, habits, schedule, etc. by utilizing informants, eavesdropping, interrogating, and pick pocketing. Once you have enough information to plan your assassination, you report to the city's Assassin's Bureau for approval to carry out your mission. Few of these information gathering sub-missions are very fun, and by the last few assassinations, they all seem like a boring chore. Yes, eavesdropping is as boring as it sounds, but after a few missions, you're happy to see that little symbol because you know it takes little work to accomplish and you can go grab a beer while the dialogue drones on. Luckily, you are only required to complete a couple of these before unlocking the assassination missions most of the time. However, completing these sub-missions can aid in your assassination attempts by revealing optimal escape routes, guard locations, etc. The actual assassinations are great. I loved sneaking around the guards (or silently killing most of them) and slowly creeping into position for my final strike. Sometimes you can use the crowd to get close; other times the rooftops might be the best option; there may also be the occasional target you just have to hunt down the old fashioned way. The beauty of this game is that they are all viable methods in almost every case. It really depends on you. As long as your target expires after you've taken flight and buried that blade in his neck, there's no wrong answer.Many have taken umbrage with the ""simplistic"" and ""unrealistic"" sword fighting element in AC as well, which is something I have had difficulty understanding. Yes, you will often be surrounded by ten or more guards who seem to attack far less often then you would expect, but in response to that I have a couple of points. 1) If you're part of a large group surrounding one guy, would you want to all go in swinging at once, possibly hacking off a friend's arm or getting your own lopped off in the process? I don't think so. 2) If you're standing in front of a guy who's only job in this life is to kill people, and almost everyone who attempts to attack him ends up with a slit throat, a blade in the gut, or a couple of broken legs, would you want to be the next one to take a crack at him? I don't think so. I found the swordplay to be immensely satisfying. I really like the counter-attack aspect of it as a change of pace from the more prominent ""hack-n-slash"" techniques most games employ. Plus, the instant kill animations for each weapon are un.be.lievable (when you're down to one enemy, go for a counter with your hidden blade equipped; if you succeed? OMFG it's badass). Just be aware that the counter-attack ability is not granted until after you've completed your first mission, so if you get frustrated with your limited arsenal at the beginning, please give it time.I should also mention that Assassin's Creed is uniformly beautiful in almost every respect, from the graphics to the animations, from the cities teeming with life to the rolling countrysides. There's really not much else to say about how this game looks. It is certainly one of the most gorgeous and immersive games of this generation.If you've made it this far, I congratulate you. I tried to tackle all relevant aspects of this game to potential buyers, but please bear in mind this is an opinion, and not the most popular one from what I've seen. Assassin's Creed does a lot of things right, and a few things very, very wrong. In the end, you could love it or you could hate it. While obviously flawed, I found it to be one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed has a well-developed story than most games in the same genre. You play as Altair, but you are actually his ancestor, Desmond Miles. Using a machine that allows Desmond to view the memories of his ancestor, Desmond can view the events Altair went through to uncover mysterious artifacts and defend them from his organization's rivals, the Templers. Story:The story progresses very well from start to finish. There are some major plot twists, but instead of letting the player revile in the shock, it moves on to the next part of the story. The last major plot twist with Altair is surprising, but it's not that much as a major ""I didn't see that coming"". While you will be surprised, you might of thought about the idea once or twice before the scene even occurred. The characters develop well.Altair is a good main character. He has the ""I don't care, I won't spare you"" anti-hero mindset(similar to Kratos from GOW series), which is always refreshing to see in a main character. Desmond is alright, but he mainly complains and whines throughout the game, which may fit the situation he's in, but still annoying.Gameplay:While the storyline was well developed, what brings the game down is the gameplay. Every way to get information for an assassination is the same. You can eavesdrop, interrogate, pickpocket, or do a mission fo an informer, which is either get all the designated flags or kill these designated people. After acquiring the go-ahead, you can go take down the target. Based off the game's title, stealth should be the main idea to take the target out, but the gameplay says otherwise. You can just walk in the area and take the target out. Once performed, you must get out of there without attracting attention, which isn't the case after Altair learns an attack counter. Once learned, you can just walk in, kill the target, and take on all of the guards, which removes the point of stealth from the game. They should of put some kind of restriction to the technique. Also, if you are in the middle of the counter, if another guard tries to attack you, the attack of the guard will not register, which, if done right, would of been a good limitation on the technique. Another thing I did not understand is the AI of the guards. The citizens' AI act their role. Cause a disturbance and they will stare at you, making you more aware to the guards, while acting normal makes you unsuspectable. The guards on the otherhand are idiotic. Kill a guard and blend in with the scholars, and they will ask who killed the other guard, while people are yelling that you did it. Kill a guard on the rooftop, and another will ask who killed him, while you walk right behind him.Music:The music is pretty good for the setting of the game and the situation at the time. When you are running from guards, the music will be fast-paced, while just in the city, the music is normal-paced. The score does not stand out though. Most people will not be online looking for the soundtrack compared to the soundtrack from a game such as Final Fantasy or Guilty Gear, but for the game itself, it suffices.Graphics:The graphics are pretty good.  It is very fluid from the transitions from Altair's position during a cutscene to the scene of another character speaking. The characters fit the setting and mood of the game. if you love graphics, you will be satisfied with the game's use of  the Blink video software.Overall:The game is pretty good for a game that I got for $20. I would recommend renting the game or buying it used(like I did) since the game has no replay value. Once you beat it, you might go back to perform some optional tasks, but you probably won't start the game over to play it all over again. if you have some extra cash to burn and you have most of the games you want for the moment, check this game out.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[For some unknown reason,there are not many games featuring the Holy Land in the time of the crusades.Maybe religious reasons,maybe not,but the certain thing is that Ubisoft announced back in 2006 that they were working on a stealth action game placed in the Holy Land,& also showed us an awesome trailer.I was happy too about it,but when I saw that the producer was Jade Raymond...a girl,I started being...you know,sceptical about the game.The concept would mix elements from the Hitman ,Splinter Cell,Thief & Tomb Raider series with a lot of unique elements added.Now,the 360 & PS3 versions of the game were released in Q4 2007,& despite the public succes the title enjoyed,the proffessional reviewers did't quite appreciate the game,& it got a couple of pretty poor reviews.I said hey,let's wait for the PC version,so that I can analyze it accordingly. Well,let's see the result.Graphics:9/10 A good first impression,the graphics in Assassin's Creed are fantastic.Very good high-res textures for almost everything (people could have been a bit richer in details),& what really impressed me was the lack of special effects.Producers nowdays use them to mask graphical glitches,but Ubisoft showed a sign of decency & didn't do that.Of course,the game has its share of bugs,but nothing too serious.The most impressing aspect of the graphics are the cities.You'll be able to walk everywhere you want in Acre,Jerusalem & Damascus.Ubisoft said that the cities were built after real plans of them.Could be,but even if they aren't,they still look awesome.The respect for architecture is certain:each city with its own building style,as it is with the three religious beliefs.The animations are great & look really real,no complaint about that.So why not 10?The bugs I mentioned earlier can be annoying (dead bodies bounce,have extreamly long hands/legs...The water looks awful,& that's a pity.But the crowds are greatly done & it's a wonder that the game works fine while thoulsands of people walk the city's streets.To draw a conclusion,the graphics are not better than in Crysis,GRID,Lost or FarCry 2.But they're still awesome,& that's what really counts.Sound:7/10 Let's take the music first,composed by the famous Jesper Kyd (same who did it wonderfully for the Hitman games).Now,the music is really really good.Too bad it doesn't fit well in the game.I mean,the music's purpose is to get you deeper into the game's atmosphere.This music doesn't.It has no specific influences for that time.Try to listen it when not playing the game & you'll see that it won't lead you to the Holy Land in the Crusades time.The voice acting is not bad,but it ain't good either.Some people sound convincing,some don't (too bad that Altair,the main character,speaks as at rehearsal,with almost no intonation).Those who sound really convincing are the preachers...the ones who speak to the crowd.But because Ubisoft had to screw it up,they repeat the same 2-3 sentances continuosly,so you'll get really pissed off & you'll get the sudden desire to make them shut up...kill them.Oh,well...The sound effects,like sword clashes..things like that,are good enough,but here I'll tell you another thing that whic was forgotten by miss Jade.To point out the religion of each of the three sities,you can't do it only with arhitecture & croud speakers.Why not some prayers,some calls to the mosques for the muslims?All she game us is a randomly generated bell toll in Acre,the Christian city..Or to point out by this mean that God,Allah or Yahveh are praised in the city would have been great.Storyline:9/10 The story takes place in two different plans.One in the Crusade Period,in the Holy Land,where assassin Altair needs to eliminate 8 targets,and the other plan in the present day,where Miles needs to recreate the actions of his antcenstor Altair,with the use of the Animus,controlled by two doctors.The story looks at first pretty straightforward,but it's very interesting if you look deeply into it.After each & every assassination there is a scene in the middle of nowhere, where Altair talks to the dying men he had just stricken.What bothers him is that everyone of these men told him that it was no point in killing them,that they served a higher goal,peace & prosperity trough every means necesarry,that they feared that after death there is nothing,& that he,Altair,didn't know what he was doing.So Altair doesn't know what to think,his mind raises many questions without answer.They all have an answer at the end of the game.The end is absolutely amazing.I mean both of them,Altair's one & Miles' one.Quite strange,but nebertheless great.Gameplay:4/10 As I said before,you'll have to assassinate 8 (or 9,I don't know exactly) persons,so 3 for each city (actually,one of them is in the outskirts,but whatever).Besides the cities,you'll have the outskirts that lead to them & the Assassin's Fortress (geez,such uninspired).Now I don't think you can go all the way from Damascus to Jerusalem or from Damascus to ACre in 2 minutes,but that's how it is in Assassin's Creed,& it's quite stupid.Duh,a motivation to use the horses,which,despite the good control,are absolutely pointless.Oh,I almost forgot,there is also a speed limit there,in the middle of nowhere,& if you exceed it the guard will be all over you.This is more that just stupid... Well,oonce you get in the city,you'll have to visit the Assassin's Bureau (another ""bright"" idea),which directs you to several leads.You need to follow at least three of them in order to receive the contract.Okay,now information-gathering is done by a number of different ""minigame"" quests,so you can choose your favorite ones each time.These quests need to be found in the city,so you'll have to scout by climbing up the tallest buildings,towers or observation posts scattered troughout the city in order to get another part of the map.Now,some of these quests are given trough informers,& if you are succesful,they'll give you what information you want to know.Now there are stealth assassination quests,where you need to kill three targets without being seen (hard),archer assassination challenges,where you need to kill archers on the rooftops without being seen (not too hard),rooftop race challenges, escort challenges (easy),etc. But the ones I recommand to do are pickpocket (it's easy,you just have to walk behind the guy who has info & press Shift to get the info out),interrogation (you need to beat up a crowd-speaker to make him tell you what he knows-easy,guard don't interfeer in fist fights),& the easiest of 'em all,eavesdrop(just sit on a bench,press F & then E to overhear a convesation).This one is absolutely supid.Instead of stealthy following them to a secure place,where you would try to stay hiddent when they speak, you need to sit on a bench in the middle of the damn city & hear their ""secret"" plans.It's as if two guys would be talking out loud in the middle of New York on how to kill Bush.Oh well,when you're done with all these,you'll get a contract & go to the place the target is.Now here's where the hardest part comes in:trying not to fall asleep while an extreamly boring ""interactive"" cutscene takes place.After that you just have to kill the target,escape the guards,& return to the bureau.Thing is,many times in those cutscenes,the targets are very exposed,but you can't kill them now,no,you need to do it when they're surrounded by guards!That being so,almost all the assassinations will end as bloodbaths,& that sure isn't the definition of an assassin.An assassin should wait for the best moment to strike,not for the worst one.So the game shouldn't be called Assassin's Creed,it should be called Mass Murderer's Creed.Okay,so this is the way EVERY assassination contract works out,so you'll get extreamly bord of the stupid & unspectacular repetivity.If you manage somehow to finish the game,you deserve a medal for your patience.I sure do! Okay,now that you know how the game's scenery works,let's talk about the control,fighting system,& the climbing system. The control is quite weird,but it is very very precise,& after a while you'll like it.For example,to run,you need to keep the right mouse button pressed while pressing space.To move in the crowd without bothering the people you'll genly push them by pressing Shift,& pressing Shift while holding the right mouse button will make you throw aside anyone in your way.Now,to climb a building you'll have to press RMB while near the wall,& keep the directional key pressed.As Jade Raymond said,you'll be able to climb each & every building you wish,but so could you do in Transformers or Hulk,so just this doesn't make it a great game.In comparison with those two though,Assassin Creed's climbing system is more credible:you don't just climb ascend the plain wall,you'll use pillars,windows,smaller rooftops,ladders...things like that.I said that it has a very precise control scheme.The jumps are very precise,you'll never fall off or miss a pillar & when jumping in the grain wagons from the rooftops you will just press RMB+Space & that's it,you'll fall directly there,without controlling your jump.And I'm not saying this as a bad thing,cause it reduces the frustration level a lot.I just remembered:you can't swim,& the smallest contact with water means instant death.Sheesh... Now,let's talk about combat mode.You'll have four weapons:fists,sword, throwing knifes & hidden blade.You imagine how fists work...the hidden blade can be used when enamies are unaware that you want to attack them.Just run towards one & hit LMB & there you go!The throwing knivfes are good as a ranged weapon.You target the enemy with F (he has to be a bit far away),press LMB & you throw a knife at him,killing him instantly.The knife can also be used as a close comat weapon,as the sword.Now,sword combat.The most stupid combat scheme with swords I've ever seen in my life.You can press LMB for a fast attack that misses everytime,& hold it for a slof,powerful attack that migh hit from time to time.But let's say you're surrounded by 10 enemies.You have to keep RMB pressed,& when one of them starts an attack,you press LMB for a counter attack that kills or stuns.Don't worry about the other enemies,cause they'll just stay & watch you kill their friends,one by one.Absolutely stupid.They're such idiots they won't strike you when your back is vulnerable,& they attack in turns,like they're playing some TBS game or so.One more strange thing:when I'm killing them,some talk & point at me while watching me swing the blade to them.What more can I say?Thing is,that's the ONLY way I used when killing enemies,& I could as well faced 100 guards gathered around me...the same result.Plus that it's boring & the moves repeat themselves again & again & again.You can also grab the enemies & throe them is some structures which collapse,wather,or off a rooftop.Speaking about rooftops,if you throw a soldier down from there,people & other guards will imediatly notice,but won't look up,they look around.Why is that,I cannot possibly understand.Okay,enough,let's talk about the final aspect,running away from guards.You can run away in the crowds,which won't work.You can climb up rooftops & hide in some small chambers with drapes around.The whole army can climb up there,but they won't try to look for you in there.Nope.Same goes for grain wagons or grain piles.Also,while running,if you sit on a bench,the guards will lose you.Why?I can't get it.Some people you save might sometimes slow down the guards in pursuit,or at least that's what the tutorial said.I never tried to see what happens.The thing is that Miles ""syncs"" to Altair's memory,& if he kills innocents he loses sync.Another very stupid thing.I once jumped from the highest building in Jerusalem & guess what happened?I lost 3 sync bars from the 16 I had.Now,if that ain't extreamly stupid,I don't know what it is.Now the most stupid thing of 'em all is blending.You can get pass every guard to reach your target if you blend.They see your weapons,but hell,it doesn't matter,you're blending!I've got nothing at all against Bush,but I'll use him as an example once again.A guy with three assault rifles & two rocket launcers on his back who wants to kill Bush gets unbothered near him,because he's BLENDING.Exactly like that is the business in Assassin's Creed.Stupid,huh?Overall Impression:5/10 All in all,Assassin's Creed had a great potential.An unexploided period of time & place of action & an excellent idea behind it.I don't know how it happened,but they screwed up bigtime.Assassin's Creed is like a demo,like a beta version.It has a couple of ideas put along together,but they still need to correct & blend them perfectly,& to add substance to the game,to make it feel like a game.I waited untill the end for ""that"" moment to come.It indeed came by the end,which means the rest of the game could have been fixed too.Hell,this could have been such a masterpiece...such a pity.It's strange that the game is both very easy & very hard.Easy because you won't have any difficulties in advancing,hard because not everybody has the patience to finish such a game.At the beggining,I said okay,pretty good game,maybe an 8 in the review.At half time,no wonder: 4 in the review,no arguments!Finally it was 7.To conclude,while playing Assassin's Creed I didn't feel at all as an assassin.I felt like myself pushing buttons on my keyboard,trying not to fall asleep or get to annoyed & banging my head on the desk from time to time.Not that it's a bad game,but when you imagine what it could have been,what a legend...]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Apologies, but for just one minute I have to join the screaming multitudes.   Let me say that there are cliff hanger endings, and there are endings that com e simply because the developers decided that the next game would begin here. Assassin's Creed has one of the later category. It's a shame that the game has such a bad case of schizophrenia - it oscillates so quickly from being engaging to being mind-blowingly dull that I wonder if it shouldn't go on prosaic, spend a weekend in Vegas and go see if it can't work out what must be some pretty troubling issues with its father. Visually, the game is superb. Environments glow, clouds and characters alike cast shadows, birds flock towards distant, fog obscured mountains. All of it is gorgeous and one realizes that the shine on this game's presentation is largely responsible for the game's positive reviews.And even technically, the game is impressive. It has several living, breathing cities that use different type of architecture (although I'm not sure how many houses were transplanted out of downtown London during the Crusades). Altair follows the Prince of Persia in having an incredibly varied move count - watch him climb laterally on the side of a building and its likely you wont see a single move repeat. Combat is entertaining, Camera work is superb. People weave in and out of traffic, and the cities are alive... even if generally its a city populated by a citizen mass that enjoys repeating itself endlessly.But the story - Oh, god, the story - What a shambles. All ""memory"" characters - and the protagonist in white most of all - are terribly realized. Writers need to learn that editing out all contractions does not make a character sound noble or historic. It makes him sound strange and off rhythm. I compare the ""present"" storyline to the ""past"", though, and the difference couldn't be more pronounced. Characters interact, they have personality, they get angry or funny or any number of emotions, and all the performance is plausible and engaging. If they had shot for a more natural sounding dialog in the past they would have had in me a rapt and attentive audience. As it was I barely listened to any of the dialog, and resented all the side quests that the game required me to take before I went a-killin'. The limited beneath the surface story, as per Halo 3, does a little revive the game but in the end its all too little, too late. In the end it's this aspect of the game that drags the other elements down.It was a decent game. But I'm selling it back today because I'm certain that I will never, ever play it again.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's creed looks like it was based on a movie, or a very good book, maybe it's because there are hell lot of cut-scenes, or maybe because the story is so great-  The main plot is about Edmund, a bartender who's ancestor was an assassin during the crusade set in Israel, the Holy Land (my home, to be more exact). while playing you switch roles between Edmund (whom you will not see often) and Altair. so mainly after some quick tutorials you will be sent doing some assassinations (after all, it is ASSSASSIN's Creed.) and it goes like this: first you will arrive at a city, look around and gather clues doing missions such as pickpocketing, assassinations, race against time, and such- when you're done, you will be given the information that will assist you assassinating.  anyhow, no matter how long the cut-scenes are, and how repetitive the gameplay can be, you will be astonished-  You can do almost anything a parkour swordsman could ever dream of! climbing up almost every building, jumping from roof to roof, accomplish various stunts, and finally busting every living form in town (well, except the civilians whom you are not supposed to kill).  Oh, about the controls, at first, their a bit of a problem, after all, the translation of the keys from the consoles to computer was quite confusing, but you will get used to it, and when you will, combat will be a lot more fun and excitement, though sometimes bit frustrating, anyway if you wanna take my advise, RENT (as usual) because if you're an obsessive video gamer, no more than 3 days will take you to complete the game, and hell, it's fun.  Have fun, and a nice day.]]>"

Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's creed is possibly the greatest action game on the market right now. It puts the player into the shoes of the main character Altair and allows him/her to explore the holy land as it was during the times of the third crusade. The beginning of the game puts Altair in Solomon's tomb, were he fails to get the target assassinated, and loses one of his team mates. Once back at your head quarters, you lose your rank and skills for failing the mission. To earn your rank back, you must assassinate 9 targets for your master... After each assassination, you get back a weapon and/or skill that will help you assassinate your target. The weapons system is a combo system were you can press multiple buttons (although when you start playing it will be mostly button mashing).  The story line is very interesting, but the game play gets somewhat repetitive for each target. Even though you might get sick of the game play, you'll beat just to find out how the story ends. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed was a game with a lot of hype before it's release.  However, when it came out, some loved it while others though it was over hyped.  I really enjoyed the game but it still could have been better.Story: Assassin's Creed tells a complex story about Altair, an assassin in the Third Crusade era in the Middle East who is ordered to killed 9 public figures.  At the same time, Desmond, one of Altair's descendent in the near future, is being used by an organization to find Altair's memory's.  The story has plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end.  However, the ending is obviously set up for a sequel as it ends of a cliffhanger.Gameplay: This game was hyped as being a revolutionary sand box game and it was.  However, while the developers succeeded in  making a great sand box environment, they forgot to add things to do in the sand box.  For one thing, in order to assassinate these 9 public figures, you have to find information on their location by pickpocketing, check viewpoints, and interrogations.  Unforunately, that is basically all you are going to be doing the entire 15-20 hours of this game.  Thankfully, it's not as bad as you think as even though the game is repetitive, it isn't so repetitive that it would completely ruin the game.  Also, the combat system is decent but not perfect as the combat can also get repetitive as there is only 2 buttons used in combat, the attack and block buttons.  Overall, the gameplay, while not perfect, is still good enough to tolerate the repetitive aspects.  This is thanks to the facts that combat is not the main selling point of this game.  It should also be noted that Altair has some great acrobatic moves in this game.Sound: The voice acting in this game is top-notch.  Coincididently, the weakest VA in the game is the main character, Altair.  There is also some great sound effects and some nice atmosphere to the whole gameGraphics: The art design in this game is remarkable thanks particially to the unique setting.  However, the game does suffer from some slowdown.  It's a very good looking game overall.Replay Value:  Let's get to the chase.  There isn't much reason to go back to this game after it is finish other than collecting flags and saving some civilians.Bottom Line: Assassin's Creed is a very good game overall even though it doesn't completely live up to it's hype.  The gameplay is good but a little too much on the repetitive side.  However, if you can look past that, you will experience an revolutionary experience as well as a great story.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed was developed by Ubisoft Montreal, the same group of developers that brought us Rainbow six Vegas 1 and 2. In the game, you play as Altair, a master at assassinating people, hence the name, Assassins creed. He is close to your basic generic protagonist. I said ""close"" because it seems that he doesn't mind killing a lot of people. You also play as Desmond Miles, but you just walk around with him. I don't really want to spoil anything with him; even though his parts are boring. But it is an interesting way to keep you in the story. The story is a love hate sort of thing. I found the premise interesting and even though I thought the ending was not satisfying enough, I want to know what happens next. But even after the ending, there are ways you can find out more about the story and its future even. For players who know nothing about the game, the start will seem like a huge plot twist; even though it's not meant to be.The assassination missions are what make most of the game. As Altair, you travel around real word locations such as Jerusalem to find and kill your target. But first, you will need to do several side missions to receive information about your target. You will pickpocket, interrogate, and ease drop on conversations to learn more about your target. Some of these are helpful in giving you tips about the guard locations and areas to sneak in. Other tips will be very vague and basically useless. For the first couple of missions, I went through and accomplished all the side tasks hoping to get some extra rewards. The only reward I got was a gain in my health meter. That was not a good even reason for me to continue on with the side-tasks for the rest for the game.Which brings me to the game's biggest problem: Repetition. Every single assassination mission has you doing the same side-tasks over and over again. Basically in the same order: you climb a building to get an eagle's eye view, save a citizen, pickpocket, and ease drop, repeat. Granted the assassinations are varied, I found myself dragging on toward the end. Another problem of the game is the combat system. Granted it is fun and slick. After you learn to counter someone's attack, you can take on hordes of guards easily. So you never get this sense of dread when fighting an enemy because you know one counter can easily take them down. It would've been cool to see the sword fights be more intense and less forgiving. The combat A.I is nothing great, but it gets the job done. Sometimes you might question why the guards don't all attack you at once, but that would make it too hard. It is cool to see how sometimes guards will run away after you slaughtered several others. The most impressive part of the A.I is when the guards chase and you look for you around the city. The smallest action may alert guards to hold their sword or even threaten you with it. Also, they will throw rocks at you if you're climbing a building. I thought that was pretty cool. BUT, it's lame to see how you can easily just go into low-profile mode and hide from these guards. You can stay in the same area after slaughtering several guards, go into low profile mode, and the guards will walk right by you. But really, the game works just fine to not water down the experience. Every counter you make will pan the camera to a sort of ""in-action"" view and Altair will perform so gruesome finisher. The atmosphere of each is city is amazing. Most of them are separated into three districts: poor, rich, and middle class. What is pretty cool is how each district has its own unique look and style to it. In the poor district, you will find a lot of beggars and drinks. But in the rich district, you will find a lot of people who snob at you and your actions. All of the details just add in the world and give the player a better experience with the game. The developers did put time to create this rich and beautiful world. The graphics are strong for a next generation game. In terms of scale, art, and geography, the game is beautiful. I found myself just stopping at looking at the scene around me. The models of the citizens are toned down a little, but this was more of a necessary down-scale because of the mass number of civilians on the screen at once. The audio is strong. The citizens' audio is a bit dubbed down, while the main characters are obviously dubbed fine. Everything sounds like it is suppose to in a well developed game like this. The music is fine, but toward the end, I wasn't too crazy about it. Assassin's Creed is a game of ambition, and risk. The developers wanted to create a game that separated itself in terms of diversity and game play. The atmosphere is rich, the story is trying to be different, and the fun elements are there. The game's length is determined by the player, it is a short story that could be finished in a determined weekend. In the end, I enjoyed Assassin's Creed for what it was: An ambitious adventure game that had a unique style to it. Assassin's Creed is a must rent, not buy.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[written feb 25, 2008.It seems to be one of those love or hate games. I personally thought i would hate it after reading the reviews, and it turned out to be one of my recent favourite games.  I think a part of the problem was the hype surrounding it until release, the fact that some people will outright hate that your playing in a simulator instead of real life (its not a spoiler if its the first thing in the game you learn), and the opinion that the gameplay is repetitive.  But something only becomes repetetive once you get sick of doing it.  I made it through the game before i had, had enough - and before I had totally mastered the combat, the climbing and jumping from roof tops was enjoyable to the end.  I really think if you try and play this game hurriedly (like most reviewers), your going to get sick of it fast. Its definitely a game where you take your time, read the bits of info you collect to prepare for the assassination, and then do it. The assassinations mix it up plenty to make it fun and intriguing, and if you challenge yourself (achievements - Full Health for each kill etc) you can get past the fact the game is to easy and focus on being totally badass. Which is one of the things that makes this game awesome at times, there are moments when you will feel like a total badass.  There have been a few complaints out there that this is not a true, stealth game. Well its not really. I guess by saying its not true stealth is just basically saying it can be a little to easy. At first i spent alot of time being inconspicuous, blending into crowds of monks, gently pushing past people, avoiding guards like the plague. Which was all well and good and added much to the games atmosphere, as it was more exciting feeling the guards eyes on me and when i did actually piss off the guards having to haul ass in exhilirating chase. This was conclusive to those feelings of being badass.  Unfortunately these were limits i was putting on myself with the use of imagination. As i progressed i found it was actually terribly easy to evade the guards, and even if they did catch me, they didnt stand much chance against my blade. The last third of the game i spent running non stop everywhere. Which was still ok, because its still slightly fun to be chased, and i enjoyed the process of mastering the combat, i was still having fun. I was still enjoying the gameplay mechanics, even though i'd unfortunately lost the atmosphere. Im assuming for many people once they get past that initial atmosphere, perhaps the gameplay just isnt appealing to them.  The combat has apparently been much lifted from a previous prince of persia game (i havent played). I found it to be a pretty good system, aside from just randomly hacking and slashing (which you can do) the game rewards effective use of countering. You unlock moves as you go which brings depth as you progress, adding grab counters etc.  The story was also far more intriguing than i thought it would be and kept me eager to see where the hell it was going, (aside from an obvious plot twist). It can sometimes be a little confused in its attempt to be thought provoking, but its there. The greater story (outside the simulator) is, uniqe and Intriguing, Im onboard for the sequel so i can get some questions answered. Its like Lost.  As far as it not being revolutionary, thats a pure falsity. Graphically Its pretty tight and polished. Although the Animation and the acrobatics are what really stand out. I cant obviously relate the game to anything else, its not GTA (not every game needs to be GTA btw), It has some similar elements as crackdown, but really they are very different games.  I was content with the ending, although certainly wouldnt have been had i not known to wait through the credits, after which the game lets you snoop around a bit scavenging tidbits to try and peice together some back/future story. Well it's sucked me in.  Now to sit and wait for the sequel.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Here is a review for Assassin's Creed, available on XBOX 360 and PS3. I played the 360 version, however I have heard of very little difference between the two. Assassin's Creed is an overall quality game. I have nothing at all to complain about in the ideas of how it is structured and what it entails. This game excels at many points that make it stand out above the rest of the open world adventure type games out there.First off we have control. Control is one of the most important aspects of gaming to me. If I cannot do what I want simply due to control issues, I get more and more frustrated. The controls are very specific, and yet, when you want to climb a wall it can be as simple at pushing the thumbstick forward. For the most part, Altair does exactly what you want him to do. There are some situations where he will struggle, but as I played I found that the overall control is positive. My only gripe here is that I do not have enough thumbs to sprint/tackle and to turn my camera at the same time, but I made due just fine.The story is a bit weird and unexpected if you are hoping for a game that has nothing but stabbing people in it. However, it does not take away from the game at all, and I think it is a nice interesting story. I will just leave the story talk at that because this review is already longer than I planned.I feel that, if anywhere, the area that Assassin's Creed falls short is in replay value. Once the game is done there is nothing to do but collect flags. Collecting items or other ""collectibles"" is always a tedious adventure in a game, or that is at least how I feel on this matter. Also, in order to get back into the game, upon beating it, can take about 5 minutes. This is because you have to sit through the chapter introduction talk again, then ride your horse to the next town again. So that tedious step only gives me another reason to play another game or make a sandwich/burrito while I ignore the introduction conversation.The main thing that Assassin's Creed could do to counter this lack of replay value would be to add a co-operative multiplayer mode. I also do not doubt that Assassin's Creed 2 will have such a mode in it. Crackdown (another game I will review soon) had a nice co-op mode that really made that game fun to play over and over. I feel that a two player way to do each of the assassination events or even explore the city together could make for a very fun experience.In closing, Assassin's Creed is a very good game for very specific reasons. If you are looking for a game that will entertain you for about twelve hours, then Assassin's Creed is the way to go. If you want a game with much replay value beyond that I would look somewhere else. All things considered though, I give Assassin's Creed a four out of five stars, simply due to the lack of replay value.Pros: Controls, Story, Nothing else is quite like it.Cons: No replay value or multiplayer.Score: 4/5 stars.Note: If replay value and multiplayer are not things that you need in a video game, then you might as well bump this one up to a 5/5 stars. I gave it a four simply because those additions would have made Assassin's Creed a game that I would still find tremendously fun today.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ I am not the person who spends hours on games but when i picked up assassins creed i could not put down the controller. The game play is not hard to use, fighting in the game is excellent and probably the best i have every seen. I found that the difficulty was very simple and there should have been different difficulty's included. I really liked how the city's looked and know that the developers put alot of hard work into making the city's alive. The story line is also a great one, i was always wanting to find out what will happen next and the story was left off so that they can make another game.  In the end assassins creed is a great game and should really be played by everyone. It is not difficult so everyone can play it and just everything about it is amazing.. it is hard to put into words how great it is. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[The press and plenty of forum posts have been rather negative on the game and not completly without reason, but overall I think a lot of it was really overreacting and missing the point.The game puts you into the role of an assassins at the time of the crusade that has to kill a handful of evildoers spread out over a handful of cities, but all that happens with a twist. You are not actually the assassins, but just some guy who happens to be a descendant of said assassins relieving its memories thanks to some sci-fi device. The sci-fi scenario happens in between the assassination missions and has a very much adventure game to it, however a rather limited adventure game, since you are limited to just three rooms and asside from talking to the two other characters and reading their email you really do anything.The beginning of the game starts out rather week, just like in Metroid Prime or a handful of other games, you start with all your powers and upgrades, but soon lose them after your first missions. Not quite sure why they did that, but I found that it disconnects you from the story quite a bit, since it just feels like a cheap trick, not something that makes much sense in terms of the story. After that is over the game goes over into routine.Missions always start out at your base where you get your orders, after that you ride to the next city where you have to solve a few minigames to gather information about where to find your target. Once done you get close to your target, watch a cutscene, kill the guy, watch another cutscene and then be back into the sci-fi setting before the circle repeats again.While this sounds repetative and certainly is to a degree, since the minigames are pretty much the same thing over and over again, it really isn't that bad, since the core gameplay is really well done. The cities themselve are huge and leave you the freedom to go pretty much wherever you like. Thanks to the ability of your character to climb you can reach basically every rooftop. The climbing in this game is quite different then in most other games, since you can not only grab ledges, but you can also grab onto pretty much anything that sticks out a tiny little bit. This allows you to climb extremely fluently and easily. The troublesome part about this is that climbing really isn't much of a challange, jumping as well as grabbing happens automatically without much user interaction, you press a button and are ready to climb around as much as you like, you just have to press the stick into the direction you want to climb. However the ease of climbing also allows you to quickly navigate around in the game world, which becomes an important point when you are involved in chase sequences or just try to get away from guards.When you come into contact with a guard you can take your sword and start a fight. Fighting in Assassins Creed feels quite close to how it was in the original Prince of Persia DOS game, namely it is mostly blocking and countering and not just wild button mashing, which I really like.Another albeit rather small part of the game is horse riding, since you can just teleport yourself to the next city in the later part of the game. Horse riding is pretty much the weakest part of the game, unlike Shadow of the Colossus you don't really have any freedom in where you want to go, the whole world is just a series of narrow roads, which leaves you with just two options: forward or backward. Every now and then you also get the choice between left and right, but thats it. There is no exploration going on when on the horse and nothing really to do.The story of Assassins Creed is kind of a mixed bag, for one thing the sci-fi twist is really interesting and well done, but on the other side it leads nowhere, you get a few hints here and there whats going on, but in the end it has ""please wait for the sequel"" written all over it. I still liked it for what it was, but I would have definitivly prefered to have a more active part in the future setting. The crusade setting on the other side is rather weak and while it is a little more conclusive, it never managed to engade you, since the reason why you shall kill this or that guy stays rather foggy for most part and you also don't really have other characters to interact with.While its interesting that the cutscenes before an assassination follow directly from gameplay, without interruption, it is also annoying that the cutscenes don't allow any interaction beside movement. So you always have to wait for them to finish, before you can start your attack. I would have much prefered it when the assassination would have been possible while the cutscene was running. Another annoying part is that you kill harmless people that give you information after the interrogation automatically. Maybe its just me, but killing unarmed people just ain't a thing that I like to do. And this isn't the first time, GTA4 had it, Call of Duty 4 had it and Uncharted had it too, i.e. basically all Playstation3 games I have played so far had such idiotic use of violence without reason, I really don't like that trend.Another small annoyance with the game is that its rather full of HUD elements, which makes finding minigames a little to easy, since you end up following icons on the map instead of looking around in the city. One weird part with the map is that later in the game, when you have to enter a new district in the city, it doesn't actually tell you what to do, instead you have to figure out yourself that you have to climb a huge building first before you can see icons on the map. Its a small thing that doesn't take to long to figure out, but for a game that is otherwise completly driven by blinking icons on the map, not having those looks more like a bug then like a game mechanic.In the end the biggest problem of the game is that its just way to mechanical, it follows a pretty strict structure for each mission that just repeats over and over again and close to the end it actually gets quite a bit worse, since it introduces minigames with a time limit, which neither makes sense nor is fun. They also seem to have run out of ideas in the last mission, since it just throws one enemy horde after the other at you, leaving nothing of the sneakiness that you would expect from an assassination game. The core gameplay also has its flaws, for example you can only hide from guards in predefined hiding spots, hiding elsewhere doesn't work, which is just another part of the game that is to mechanical.Another huge annoyance is that the game doesn't have a real sandbox mode, whenever you want to reenter a city that you already have solved earlier, you have to rewatch the introductory cutscene of that mission again and again, so it can take multiple minutes till you are finally in the city where you want to be. This only becomes a real issue after you finished the game and want collect some remaining flags or stuff, but then it really becomes a huge issue since it makes it impossible to just do a quick dive into the gameworld and have some fun. For some reason the game also lacks subtitles, little weird in times where basically every game has them.With all its faults however the game succeeds for most part at creating a huge interactive world, starting a fight with guards can be repetitive, how you proceed with that fight however can be pretty dynamic. You can flee over rooftops, block their way with civilians, fight them and all kinds of stuff, you have pretty much the whole city to toy around with and that is what makes the game a lot of fun. Chasing another character through the city is equally fun and dynamic. So while some parts of the game can by repetitive I can easily overlook that since the core exploration and navigation through the city is just good old fun and it is also something that feels new and fresh and leaves you plenty of freedom. Something that not many games these days manage. None of the flaws in this game really matter much in the end, since I simply had fun with it from start to finish. It could have been better for sure, but as it is, with all its flaws, its still pretty damn good and so far my favorite PS3 game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassins creed is quite old now so my review probably won't be viewed by many people (if at all) but I am simply doing this for the sake of practice and enjoyment.  Firstly in Assassins Creed you play as Altaïr a master assassin during the third crusade in 1191 AD. Well actually it's set in the near future and the sections of the game set in the crusades are just a simulation that your near future character is playing through using a machine called the Animus. The only reason I can think of for Ubisoft to tack on this idiotic sci-fi sub plot is to get some of the sillier nerds all riled up. Apart from that very minor spoiler I will leave you to find out the rest of story by playing the game (or just read it off Wikipedia, but who am I to tell you what to do I'm not god).  The presentation of Assassins creed is by far its best point, the game looks wonderful. When you climb to the view points and pan your camera around the city it is actually quite mesmerizing. The lighting effects are also extremely good, and the strange blue tint everything has in acre practically had me foaming at the mouth with artistic wonderment. There is no denying that Assassins Creed is probably the best looking game I've played so far on the xbox 360. The animations in the game are also extremely good, but that goes without saying since this game is made by some of the people who worked on Prince of Persia. The sound is top-notch especially the crunching noise it makes when your fist comes into contact with an annoying beggar woman's face, and trust me when you have played the game you will feel like doing this quite often.   The game-play itself is very impressive, you can swing on flag poles, shimmy along edges and most impressive of all you can climb on anything that looks climbable from window ledges to decorative masonry around mosques. The 3 massive cities in the game (Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus) are all completely explorable. They are full of guards, beggars, lepers and thugs who all behave uniquely. Not to mention they have thousands of citizens - rich and poor - who wander around going about their day to day business. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop and racing across scaffold away from a small army of city guard after completing a successful assassination never seems to get old. But it takes the thrill away when you realise that once the guards catch you, you can easily dispatch large groups of them without even breaking a sweat. And the combat itself is essentially just button mashing and it feels very underwhelming in a game where everything else (namely the jumping and climbing) is of such a high caliber. And considering the last sections of the game consist mainly of combat this is quite an anti-climax. Ubisoft seem to be attempting to make a new genre or game with assassins creed which they refer to as ""Social stealth"" in which you hide from gaurds in groups of scholars and slowly and inconspicuously make your way to the rooftop above your target so you can jump down and give him a nice sharp surprise with your blade. And after you've done this pretty much the entire city is on alert. But once again you are encouraged to use the environment to your advantage by useing large crowds of panicked citizens as a means to block pursuing guards. Although one thing that did annoy me was that the lepers would use all of their strength to knock you off your feet when you got close, but if a city guard walked past he wouldn't even blink.  Assassins creed is around 10 hours long if you just progress through the missions required to finish the game but if you want to get 100% completion it might take around 30hours. Despite being around 20hours long for the average gamer who'll do a fair bit of faffing around in the big open cities about 80% of the main story line is spent gathering intelligence before the assassinations by pick-pocketing and eaves dropping on various people around the city. And believe me when I say that this section of the game is completely boring after the first few tries and it just feels like it was inserted just to make the game last a bit longer. However the actual assassinations which these intelligence gathering sections build up to are very very well done and genuinely fun.  So overall Assassins Creed is worth a look, it's bogged down by unnecessary intelligence gathering missions that are very repetitive. But apart from that the game is a very good and memorable romp but don't expect much re-playability. 7.5 out of 10]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a game about a man named Desmond (That's right, not Altair) who is caught up in a crazed science experiment, for the pursuit of figuring out the past of Altair, an assassin who lived in the year 1191 A.D. How are they going to discover this through a present- day bartender? Well, the mad scientist has discovered that people's memories are stored in their DNA, and that Altair is an ancestor of our Desmond. Believable? Not a bit. Do you mind, or do you just wanna stab someone? That's what I thought. So, as you go through the memories of Altair, you are occasionally getting pulled out of the memories to see the scientist and his assistant talking about things you have no idea about, and you basically wait to get back into the action. Graphics in this game are no doubt great. They aren't the best you will ever have seen, but they are without a doubt gorgeous. You will find yourself getting into trouble just because you wanted to see how he looked when climbing something in particular ( Save you some time, a little itchy). Anyways, the character animations are the real thing that you notice, as the character moves nearly flawlessly at all times, no matter what he is doing. As a very free game, you will definitely want to push your game as far as you can, which in my experience will get you stuck in people, walls, benches, and even freeze your PS3. When climbing, you may notice some strange things (i.e. arm going through his body) which are mostly just because of the strange ragdoll style climbing method (hands and legs are free to move separate from the body).Sound in this game is for the most part very nicely done. The voice acting is never overdone, although many o the accents surprised me, not that it took away from the game at all. Weapons hit with great sound and feedback, which is greatly appreciated. Every sound you could need in there is there, and is the right volume to make you feel immersed. The only problems I would have is the annoying beeps you would get being chased, and when in very long chases when you are unexperienced, you might just want to stab your ears until the blood will fill your buds to stop the sound (might). In game script is the biggest problem, hearing the same thing over and over again, just in different accents,sometimes within the next second. When climbing you will hear the same thing constantly that makes you want to just shank them all (which would make you lose, so :( to that)Gameplay is my most awkward experience in this game. Free running is without a doubt the most fun you'll have in this game, as I was still having fun even when I had already beaten the game. The chase is sometimes fun when you are doing crazy fast lines around the city, dodging and assassinating at every turn. But when you are frustrated by those guards attacking you just for walking closeby, not scholar- like, You most likely will want to attack them and defeat them quickly instead of being chased around for 10 minutes trying to find an extremely obvious place to hide.Controls are very tight, not much to say, the fight is very simple, not too difficult to pick up and be great at, with fights afterward not getting much harder. You will have two types of control schemes, high profile and low, toggled by holding and releasing the R1 button. Controls are mapped to the face buttons, Triangle putting you into first person Intuition/ Eagle Vision mode, Square drawing your weapon, Circle using your open hand to grab people, and X to dodge, climb, anything like that.The story, the most important part of any game, is confusing. Not to say that it is bad, but, it is confusing. As you play through the game you will continually change sides to root for in Altair's memory, as you play as Desmond you just get less and less confused, and in the end much more. The two stories really never cross indefinitely, but as the first part of three games, there really isn't much to complain for.Assassin's Creed is fun. Not really much to add, so if you read any of my rambling, read that sentence. This game should apply to nearly everyone, and is a good rent at least, and a definite buy if you like to find those little collectibles tucked away everywhere (I really don't know how people can collect all of those, there's a lot). It's an easy 8.5 for being a great game that you can easily run through without even noticing you did anything (Just like White Castle).]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[It's a rare thing in this day and age for game publishers to take a genuine risk and invest in a game concept that steps outside the norm. So I was extremely excited by the potential of Assassin's Creed when I first saw its debut trailer.   Assassin's Creed tries something truly innovative by combining a third-person ""parkour"" (free-running) simulation with interactive crowd dynamics. The concept revolves around a character named Altair who is compelled to embark on a series of assassination missions during the time of the Crusades in order to restore his honor after committing a prideful mistake.  Each mission centers around taking out a different target, all of whom are playing a part in fueling the Crusades. The pacing of each attack, from sneaking up on the target to executing the strike, to fleeing from the ensuing soldiers, is genuinely thrilling the first time. Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed takes this formula and recycles it over and over again, creating a palpable sense of repetition.  The main missions aren't the only repetitive elements; the side missions (climbing towers to scan the city, taking out other targets) and pre-mission errands (spying on pedestrians, pick-pocketing, interrogation) suffer from the same syndrome. What's more, while AC's free-running mechanics exhibit fluid animation and offer enormous freedom, they're not designed well for the chaotic getaway missions.  Still, AC is a stunner in the visuals department (both graphics & art style), and the combat system is very engaging (though it becomes repetitive after awhile too). In sum, AC leaps for a high rooftop, but ultimately doesn't have the legs to make the jump. With great gameplay variety and smoother getaway mechanics, Assassin's Creed could truly have been something special.]]>"
Assassin'creed,
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a game that you will want to play just once :(...and that's really bad,because I waited for a game that will breaks the cliches,but I was very wrong.Yes the game has its story,graphics,sound effects...but the gameplay feels weak.All kinds of climbing,freeruning,sneaking were very cool,but the missions repeat ALL THE TIME.There some people that you have to kill (very important people) and there are 3 cities-Damscuss,Acre and Jerusalem.There is only one guy per city...and every time before assassinating the VIP you have to go through the same missions (investigations-stealing,evesdroping...).The first two-three times they were cool,but later it's just boring and you pray only to finish the missions,so you can assassinate the VIP.The way of killing people is actually very,very cool and original.You can kill with the sword,you can kill with knifes,with handknife and it's well done.But the fighting is very weak,because only thing you do is block and wait for someone to attack you so you can counter-attack him and kill him.But if gameplay is weak,the plot feels very solid and interesting.You play as а young guy from the near future and his predecessor-Altair who's actually a assassin from the Medieval times.The graphic is great and you can feel the wide world and the surroundings.The sound effects are very cool and realistic.The only problem was the boring missions.You will have a good time playing it,but at the end you will not feel so...great.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[If you've heard of this game before, you'll probably know the concept. You Explore three massive cities finding out about your assassination target and the killing him. You have to kill 9 targets throughout the game and by the end you'll have pretty much know exactly what to do each time, but there's enough variety that you won't get bored unless your the impatient type. The gameplay consists of three elements, free running, combat, and hiding in the crowd. While all three of these work quite well hiding in the crowd while trying to get some where is rather slow so you might want to resort to free running across the rooftops. The free running portion of the game consists of jumping from rooftop to rooftop with ease, you merely hold down two buttons and press forward. Free running is probably the most fun part of the game, It's amazing to look at and exhilarating  when your being chased by guards close on your tail, once in a while you might fall of a roof into the streets when you take the wrong turn but this just opens up another part of the game, combat. Combat is simple and fun but can get annoying sometimes, but that's ok, because you can run away from a fight any time and continue to run away from your pursuers. The combat in the game consists of fighting many enemies at one time, You will have an attack button a block button and a reversal button, you will mostly be using reversals because they will usually finnish off your foe and will show off some of the most brutal finishing moves you've seen in a long time. and that leaves hiding in the crowd. When hiding from guards your best bet is to stay on the rooftops, but when this isn't an option you can blend in with the crowd. The amount of people in these three massive cities is phenomenal. You will be amazed, and because of the large number of people It's not to hard to blend in. You can press a button that will make you pose as a monk making you practically invisible away from you, you can also drop a dead body that ever so conveniently died in the middle of a crowd to direct attention away from you. so that you can slip by. And what would be the point of being an assassin if you don't have a target. As I mentioned before, you must kill 9 targets in the game. Each one will be assigned to you in a small village in which the Assassin's creed is based. Then you will travel to whichever city in which you must kill this person. But you cannot merely go up to this person and stab him first you must find information about him, and this is where the one major flaw of the game lies. At first finding information about the target isn't so bad, you might have to interrogate someone, or listen in on a conversation. and while fun the first time, after a couple times it just starts getting boring, but luckily you can zoom through these missions quickly enough so that you can get to the killing. When you finally get to kill someone you have multiple ways in which you can do it. Your target will usually be in some fortress or something, and you have to figure out how to get in. You could find a way through the back, or through the roof, and then stab him from behind or above, Or you could take the more violent approach and just storm through the front gate, sword drawn. All of these methods are fun, but it really gets good after you killed your target. After you've killed this guy the whole city will be looking for you, and you have to make it back to a safe house without being followed, and man are you in for the chase of your life, this is running across rooftops at it's best. So all this seems all well and good, but what really makes this game great is the cities. These things are huge, they have amazing graphics and there are three of them not to mention the even bigger wilderness in between the cities. Your jaw will drop. and to back this all up you have a great story too. Full of fun plot twists. I don't want to give away much, but it's mostly about a creed of assassins during the crusade, and you are the best assassin who is stripped of his rank for betrayal and must kill nine targets to get his reputation back. The plot also takes an interesting turn into modern times but that's all I will say. This game does set up for a sequel at the end and does have a mediocre cliff hanger, similar to how halo 2 left you dazed an confused at the end, But this can all be forgiven when the sequel comes out (hopefully). This game has spectacular gameplay that is somewhat dragged down by repetitiveness and a compelling story, for anyone who has 30 bucks (20 bucks if you can get it used). And if you want a new gameplay experience or are just looking for a good story line in an action game. The I recommend getting this game.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a great game that due to a few small technical problems is held back from being the ambitious experience it wants to be.It looks amazing visually. The animations for the main character are very intricate and detailed, and this detail is consistent with every other person you come across throughout the game. Outside of the animation, the ancient Middle East atmosphere that the game is set in is extremely immersive. The first moment that you gaze off into the distance from the top of the tallest tower in Jerusalem, you will see how amazing the city recreations are.But for every awesome moment there is always something equally as annoying or frustrating waiting just around the corner, sometimes literally.The story in concept is very intriguing. Full of mysteries and conspiracies about the world, it will definitely keep you wondering what happens next. But these sequences only make up about twenty percent of the game. The rest of it is...well, I guess a little bit of explanation is necessary first. You play as Desmond, a bartender who is being held prisoner by the Abstergo Corporation while they test a machine called an Animus on him. Without going into spoilerific detail, the Animus is basically a big TV screen screen on which you play your ancestor's memories. There is no gameplay outside the Animus, aside from slowly walking around and talking to the doctors who work the machine. Even though this is all you can do, the storytelling here is the best in the game, and its only about twenty percent of it. Once you lay your buzzcut, hoodie-wearing head down on the Animus, you play a completely different game. One that isn't remotely as compelling.Inside the Animus is where you actually play the game. You become an ancestor to Desmond, named Altair. Altair is a member of the Brotherhood of Assassin's, or, at least that's what I think it's called. The story in this main portion of the game is a mixture of boring ancient speaking styles, long hard-to-pronounce names, and plot changes that seem to have already been discussed before you realize that they even happened. But where the story falls short is made up for by the actual assassinations that you carry out, you are an assassin after all.The assassinations are undoubtedly the best part of the gameplay. The feeling of anticipation as you climb the walls and roofs to your target's hiding spot, or hide in the nearby crowd as they move closer to you is something that isn't done very often, and definitely not with this much original style. Unfortunately, you only do about nine of these throughout a 10 to 15 hour game. The rest of the time is spent walking around the three main cities gathering information about the target. Only a few of these reconnaissance activities actually have to be done in order to go ahead with the assassination, but to know everything you can, you have to do all six of them. It's not so bad, until you realize that there are only five types in the entire game. This amount of repetition tends to ruin the overall pace of the game, making it a struggle sometimes to want to advance the already weak story.The game's strength's lie in the way that Altair moves about the city. His range of movement coupled with the level of detail in the animation makes the simple act of climbing and even walking fun. One of the original ideas introduced in Assassin's Creed is the Altair's ability to use parkour to quickly get from one end of the city to the other. It is extremely simple to control, but sometimes a little too simple, to the point where it can cause more problems than solve them. To use this ability, you simply hold one button while you run, and point in the direction that you want to go. Pretty simple right? But apparently Altair doesn't have any common sense when it comes to knowing how to stop. Not pulling back on the speed in enough time, and we're talking a window of less than a second here, will cause him to reach the end of a ledge or rooftop and just jump to his death. This can be especially frustrating in a late game section where you are required to jump across a couple of small perches over water, and you can't swim. Climbing uses the same easy hold-and-point mechanic as parkour does. It feels a little better here though, since the speed in which Altair climbs is much slower and methodical. Occasionally, being a few millimeters off on the the analog stick when you are ascending a wall will cause you to stop and be stuck there as you fumble with the controller trying to finding the right direction, even though the handhold you are trying to get to is right next to Altair. This can be a little troublesome when you are trying to escape from guards, since they will throw rocks at you that immediately knock you back to the ground if hit. Overall though, these are small issues that aren't gamebreaking in the least.Even with its few flaws, Assassin's Creed has such a unique concept and gameplay style that they make up for much of the story and movement problems that sometimes keep the game from flowing well. While Altair's story was pretty lackluster, Desmond's excellent one opens up much more by the end and it becomes clear that the developers have great plans for the inevitable sequel. If there is anything that can be taken from Assassin's Creed, it is excitement for what Ubisoft will do with this franchise in the future, both in gameplay and in story. But until then, this is a great starting point. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed is one of those games that can impress anyone simply by a picture or a video, the amazing visuals come with an excellent and intriguing story. There are two stories happening at the same time, one takes place in the year 2012 when a bartender named Desmond Miles is kidnapped and forced to be the subject of tests for a company, basically one of his ancestors was an assassin and they are doing tests with his DNA to search for remains of memory from this ancestor. The other story is with this very ancestor, named Altair, who is an assassin, and his quest to eliminate targets commanded by his master, Al Mualim.Some might say the game mechanics are overwhelmingly repetitive, I say it fits right at the purpose of the game, you in the role of an assassin who needs to investigate and eliminate targets, you're given a name and a location, it's up to you to find the victim. It's also up to you how to approach the target, and how to take him down, the moments preceding a kill are sure to be exciting. To make the investigations on your target you first need to recognize the place, so you climb at some of the various high points in each city and examine the surroundings, by doing that you spot numerous places for information gathering. Then it's time to go on and actually get the information, it can come from hearing other people's conversations, pickpocketing items from people around the city, forced interrogations or from another of your fellow assassins scattered around the cities, they will surely ask you some favor in return that revolves around killing stalkers or collecting some flags around.Often, you're gonna be summoned by your master, who will give you the orders and targets' names, you need to kill nine different persons, with the orders in hand you head to one of the three big cities, Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus; reaching the specified location you need to find the city's assassins bureau and speak to the representative assassin there, he will help you a little bit and show you the better places and directions to start searching and gather information, but the actual target's location will be up to you to find by what you discover in the streets.The real fun about this game is the stealth and assassination system, you are forced to stay unnoticed, due to obvious reasons, and will be given a Synchronization Bar which tells you how much health you have; it also gives you another important information, how noticed you are at the moment. If the center of the triangle in the bar is white you are completely unnoticed, no one knows you're there, people don't even know you exist. If it gets yellow things are still good for Altair, but citizens and guards around you know you're there, at this moment they don't necessarily already know you're a cold-blooded assassin with uncontrolled thirst for blood but they are aware of your presence, so watch out your actions; depending on your actions the center of the triangle will start blinking and if the actions are extreme or too much out of the socially accepted a guard may start watching Altair's actions, which will give you a red alert. Note that only the center of the triangle changes at first, for the entire triangle to become yellow or red certain requirements must be reached. An entire red alert is when the guards are chasing you with you on their sight, and an entire yellow triangle is when you're in a chase but out of the guards sight. If you're only a suspect yet, only the center will blink and change color.The last color you have is blue, the blue color appears when you were being chased, broke their line of sight, and successfully hid yourself in one of the locations available to you, which are benches, rooftop gardens, haystacks, haystacks carts and blending within scholars. After a few seconds hiding you should be fine to continue your quest normally. When you're being chased you can either fight or run away and hide, if you choose to fight, other guards may come in and confront you too, eventually they will stop swarming and you'll be free to go, but you should exit the battle location quickly because other guards will reach the spot and start asking question about what happened there and who was the responsible for that mess, and since you're the responsible for that and the streets are full of citizens with enough will to talk, it's better to disappear as fast as you can.There's not much variety in the tasks you are asked to do, that's true, but they are always pretty fun and seems incredibly real. You have immense freedom on how to achieve your objectives, and that adds to the non-linearity of the game, allowing you to choose which sources of information you should go for or which place to visit first. What makes this game really shine is how easily you feel immersed, not to mention the overall idea which is very out of the ordinary, and ultimately executed amazingly. Controlling Altair through the alleys of the immense cities, jumping from rooftop to rooftop, trying to keep the appearances of a normal citizen just walking around will keep your adrenaline high, and when the action finally comes and you have to evade the persecutors, the climax of adrenaline kicks in.All that come alongside with one of the most amazing aspects about this game, the graphics. They're beautiful, absolutely gorgeous, it's certainly one of the best technical graphics as for today. They're not only technically impressive, and that's what makes them so amazing, they're artistically coherent. The cities are flooded with people, average people of all kinds, merchants, scholars, beggars, guards. Every city has three types of districts; the poor, the middle and the rich district. Each show differences in architecture, number of beggars, quantity of guards, etc; and each will be available at some distinct point of the game. You can climb on basically every single building in any of the cities, and it's easy to do so, just by pressing one or two buttons and running against a wall and you're done, the system is simple and easy but still leaves you the impression of freedom, and without being too simple for its own good.Spoken dialogs are practically mandatory for today's games, and Assassin's Creed is no exception, every dialog has voice-over and it was nicely done. The story develops in a very interesting way, with the character evolving and learning to question his own acts, and the acts of the ones in his group, especially the ones with most power. Each assassination you're asked to perform demands a different kind of approach and to think about what you're about to do, sometimes will be easy to just go there and kill with just some guards following you, but sometimes will be harder and could even demand different kinds of strategies and some serious stealth action from your part. The fights are actually pretty fun, there are some techniques that helps them to not fall into a mere systematic button-mashing.There's no multiplayer, but the lasting single player experience will probably make you come back for more after you finish it for the first time, just to do everything you've done, but now after you mastered the controls, using different kinds of approaches, and really getting into the intriguing and complex story. It's not a surprise to see they added lots of collectibles to keep you playing long after you finished, and there really are numerous things to be found, hundreds and hundreds of flags scattered all around, various Templars for you to kill, and of course, all that in a world full of little details, alleys and hidden places. A tricky task, and a very satisfying one as well.In the end what you get is a game that succeeds truthfully in putting you in the skin of an assassin, the job might sound tedious to some but it should be done, and you probably will do it since it's really fun, but the very nature of this game puts it in the love or hate field, if you like the adrenaline of stealth action in an amazing 12th century atmosphere this game should be a must play. It's safe to say Assassin's Creed hides much more within its richly detailed graphics and apparent repetitive missions, and ends up being a prime example of a game that has a soul.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I give this nice beautiful game a 4 1/2 i really love the killing methods. the nice dagger. ohh its so beautiful. i won't lie that it kinda doesn't get any farther than that but its just so satisfying walking up to the back of a guard and killing them on the spot. i really love using the short sword the most. its kinda of anoying tho because i tend to use my throwing daggers up while im using the short sword.. >< i hate the regular sword alot.  i mean the long sword is no assassin's weapon at all!!! it makes an assassin look ""bruteish"" basicly wreaks the image of assassin... ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I loved this game when i got. I ended up playing for 2 days straight and beat the story mode just to realize i missed some achievements. So, me being the achievement whore i am went back and played it again. Once you beat it your basically done though. So i'd suggest that you rent it.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[I had been waiting a while for this game to arrive and I was not disappointed when it did. My first impressions of the game was that the graphics looked superb, I mean the detail in each city is simply fantastic with the stark contrast of the rich sectors to the poor sectors is simply brilliant.   I found the whole intro to the game rather strange but it was soon explained and I quickly became immersed in the detailed storyline. The storyline is quite strange as there really are two storylines with the Crusade-time story and present day story running parallel it can get a bit confusing at times (maybe it was just me!!!).   The gameplay in the game is really easy to grasp and withinn 5 to 10 minutes you'll be jumping across rooftops and performing stealth kills on unsusecting guards. The fight system in the game is something I really enjoyed about this game as you can engage several guards at once without being quickly overwhelmed (especially with the counter moves).  The only bad points of the game in my opinion are that it does become quite repetitve as you do seem to perform the same tasks on your way to the big kill and this can become annoying if it weren't for visuals and fight system. Also on the last level I kept getting 2 Altaïr's and couldn't finish the game! (Seriously irratating!!!!) I then found out that this happened if you had two Xbox controllers connected!  Overall I found this to be a brilliant game with stunning visuals and great gameplay, although the ending is strange and frustrating. Roll on Assassin's Creed 2!]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed was scheduled to be Ubisoft's next franchise after the Prince of Persia Trilogy. Everyone was excited, adventure lovers and fans alike. There wasn't a reason NOT to be excited, for this was to definitely spark off something immersive and innovative for the genre. Unfortunately, in my opinion Assassins Creed doesn't continue the success of the Prince of Persia Trilogy and is an overrated game but there are plenty of solid despite dragged on areas of the game to be had.Assassins Creed follows a free roaming, sandbox like experience. There is a relatively long tutorial which can take the average player 20 minutes, replaying users cannot skip this tutorial and while it's certainly helpful for the time it takes, it doesn't explain the most disappointing aspect of the game which is the missions. Finding and traversing the missions using your compass is very confusing, in fact there were so many points on the map, I found it hard to know which one you had to go to. The towns and villages are on the most part the same with the same roads and roof tops which don't help either, but when you actually get onto a mission that's another quest in itself. I'd sit on a bench to start an eavesdropping mission when there would be no indication of how start it or when to start it.The variety of the missions wasn't that great either. They were recycled far too often swinging back forth and forth. There were eavesdrop and interrogation missions but that was the core section of the missions. While relying on some parts of stealth, it didn't rely on any form of combat or platforming puzzles which were disappointing. The missions aren't explained very well either as written above, the tutorial doesn't give you any help of the missions aside little help pop ins. Assassinations would be quite fun if they had different possible actions. Different takes on assassinations aren't implemented because you literally have to execute them. You can't get ten metres within the target without them noticing you despite you are blended in pretty well, there are no dives off buildings and stab the target as seen on the trailer. You literally have to swipe your way through the guards and then slash the target. In spite of the sandbox part to assassinations, executing targets are quite fun and don't prove to be a huge challenge but nonetheless you do get that sense of accomplishment when defeating them because of the amount of effort gone into driving through these sometimes confusing and frustrating missions. The targets are quite well fleshed out too as to why they are targeted.The story is a mixed bag because it has a specific targeted audience. You may probably want to stop reading this review now if you love action packed fast moving movies or hate historical stories. Assassins Creed's story follows two simultaneous stories. At first, not explained very well except you're a normal young man and secretly taken in by a company who have developed technology on tracking peoples late ancestors through their genes. This company takes you in; you're drugged and wake up to be found on a slab with no rights whatsoever. You have no freedom; you are captivated in a confined area where you are tested on. A scientist and an assistant are two protagonists in the game of which are well fleshed out as the story goes on. The characters aren't especially memorable but are well developed. This is where your Assassin comes in. After the tutorial of which is excused for a practise memory sequence of your brain, you're a historical assassin and are employed in the Creed who follow specific commandments. They fight for the peace but kill anyone who has disobeyed the Creed or committed murder or along those lines anyway. You are regarded from your leader as an arrogant young man (like the future ancestor captivated). You are to hunt down anyone who is wasteful to the world whether its colonisation or slave labour. The game unfortunately has a depressing feel to it with the loading screens. While running around in empty spaces is more amusing than reading health and safety loading screens, the dull backgrounds gave me amnesia and déjà vu quite alot of the time. Towns can have invisible walls which are quite annoying seeing as the towns play a big part of the game as there are only a dozen, rather than the environments or surroundings outside of the towns having the invisible walls. Furthermore, the game isn't fluid throughout; there are a dozen separated areas which contain these walls. But at first glance, they may seem like invisible walls but in fact are portals onto the other side as they can only cram in so much content into one area. Pale in comparison to Oblivion where the world is constant throughout in spite of few frame rate stutters and graphical pop ins. Additionally when approaching these little portals, frequent frame rate stutters can annoy you before and after the portals. There also glitches here and there but the frame rate is what can annoy you mostly. Although the game does innovate a few things; you can ride horses from one town to another which is quite amusing and can save long tedious travels. Riding horses is fun, you can even fight while on your horse (and no, you can't joust). As you progress through the game there are ranks, not developed ranks but specific ranks. You can't expect to kill a soldier and be given experience instead you are upgraded at different parts in the game with new armour and equipment so you don't have any RPG free roaming elements like skills or stats.One thing Assassins Creed does contain that the Prince of Persia trilogy did not was the free roaming experience. You can climb buildings, traverse roof-tops and so on. The ability to do anything you wish, up to a limit that is. You are given a synchronization bar which relates to your future ancestor. You can die for two reasons. 1) You are killed by a soldier or you fall from a big jump. 2) You kill an innocent, for that you lose one bar. At the start of the game you have five bars, from then on like above at specific points in the game you are given more bars to mess around with. If after time you have a few left it does regain but only after so long. That's what I found so much fun with Assassins Creed. Just killing an innocent and trying out different methods of escape. Either blending in or just running away. Next to your bar, you have a reading to whether you are still being hunted, escaping or are free. This helps alot on chases and you also have a cinematic view on chases which can be quite fun to view on despite one or two camera issues while doing so.What's also clear in Assassins Creed is that, there are some clever game play implementations. Most are including his array of stealth animations from blending in with the crowd or keeping your head down by sitting on a bench. Many buttons produce many different styles of play. You can blend in with the crowd as stated above with X, Circle can be used to leave fights or place your weapon back in its designated pocket. Triangle is called ""Eagle Vision"" , a easy way of identifying innocent or suspicious artificial intelligence. Although, you may know what kind of person they are whether they are just citizens or guards is backed up with the fact that suspicion can give you clues whether someone found out who did the murder. It's quite clever in reality. The graphics are one of the main selling points for Assassins Creed. First off, the characters are endearing and proficient in the way they are slickly presented. The environments are beautifully rendered but there is a downfall to all this, the environments are a little repetitive and can continue on for a bit to long until the next set piece of scenery. Despite this lighting and shadowing is incredible. The Altair always has his shadowed hood while you are constantly changing the angle to desperately see his face. Textures never fall short and on the whole you've got one of 2007's highlights in terms of graphics.The sound is a bit dragged on as far as that goes. The dialogue feels drought and drowsy, the script overstays its welcome and on the whole despite the solid voice acting it's just a bit boring and un-enthusiatic. The atmosphere is over exaggerated and while good, neither did it make me feel completely immersed into the game. This maybe because the missions were found to be confusing which left me frustrated, but at the end of the day the sound was solid but neither fantastic nor memorable.Unfortunately, Assassins Creed doesn't just target one specific genre. It targets a theme inside a genre. One that, one could only appreciate given the fact they may appreciate the theme plus the given genre. The story and sound are all intended for history buffs who love the complexity and patience, the missions are confusing and frustrating but the graphics are superbly endeared throughout the game. On the other hand, the game play is also finely crafted aside it is repetitive. All into account it depends whether your one of those people that can handle one of those games, no matter how much effort I put into loving in it it all came out into a decent game, nothing more. I highly recommend renting it if you are still unsure and then if you do love it, well just buy it!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.Pros.

Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[After finishing the game, my immediate thought was how incredibly repetitive it was. The game looks beautiful and the gameplay elements are simple and fun, the parkour aspects for example are great, but at the end of the day there isn’t enough to do, and the game makes you do the same things over and over again. But for the fact it was relatively easy to do and I was making decent progress through it I might’ve given up, but the story was interesting enough to have me see it through.It felt like it wasn’t enough of a full game, and they had to pad it. Which is a shame to say that because it’s otherwise quite impressive. Three very large, living breathing cities and compelling (enough) fight mechanics, and unbeatable parkour acrobatics. Maybe the sequel will get it to where it needed to be.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[This game is fun and all but only in the beginning. Later on however it gets really repetitive and story is really really boring. Wait! ... Hold up !!! its in the future ! ?!?!?!  Story: Hi, I am Altair and because of my ignorance you are forced to play this whole game and kill some really important villains as an order from the boss. I feel sorry for the developers who were really that lazy to the extent they did not bother improving the story while others worked their ass off on the visuals and sound effects.  Game play: Its really simple and easy. very similar to that of prince of persia. You ride horses climb towers and stab people with swords, knifes and punch the crap out of them.  Graphics: Wonderful visuals of the most beautiful cities of our old time. Damascus, Jerusalem, Acre and etc. Very realistic and often tend to blow your mind.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Maybe it was all the hype around this game that made my expectation high for assassin creed or maybe it was something else? i really don't know because it was a long time ago and the hype high was long but over since the game was release in store. One thing i can say about Assassin creed is that it looks beautiful from the city to the country side you can see all the details that the developers put in the game once you stand there and take the moment to look at the environment. I can see why other gamers would love this game but to me the falls short of my expectation, to me its in between great and a ok game.   The story begins with a character name desmond miles which is captured by two scientist that was forcing him to go back in time to find out more about this ancestor in the middle east. to fix the problems in the future. His ancestor he plays in the past was a assassin group that he works for a do mission to assassinate important people that believes to be ''evil''   The games story presented was a questionable thing for me, it left the sense of feeling of not understanding what was really going on. It left me out of the inner circle of what the scientist really what with his ancestors and him. why he was locked into a room with Lucy all the time. I just wish the presented was told a little better and more information about the scientist would of been great.   Assassin Creed presented the story in the game was really great and presented itself to the viewers of the game with sense of understanding part of what was going on. The only thing that i had the problem was with the dept of the game, i just wish they gave out a little more information about what the two scientist want with his ancestor and why they want to kill him afterwards if its really for the ''good'' it take a while to get to use of the controls of the game because of its different buttons to certain action  movement. When you press a wrong button you can find yourself dead or doing something that you really don't want to do while fighting in a big crowed city surrounded by guards. ''climbing up walls'' for instance what happens when i press the wrong button.   Perhaps one of the things that enjoyed about assassin creed was the world was free to explore, you can see everything from the city to the country side. The busy streets of follow the leader pot holding line or take a deep breath of everything in the city from scaling the massive towers structure of the outter city limits. You can do a little rooftop dancing while trying to get away from guards or ballet your way through the crowed streets either way its really fun.   Before you get to assassinate the target you would have to do some endless task that repeats itself in every mission thought the game. yes it gets boring but you would have to do it to progress in the game to get the ''information''that is needed. These task considers you to do three things eavesdropping that requires the players to sit on the bench and press the  button,pickpocket get your assassin close then press another button and there's beat up a person mission which requires you to beat up a person to get information. Like most of the stealth games that iv played in the past, creed stealth mechanics are buggy and sometimes work or not. it makes it pointless to even use stealth if you cant get a clean kill or get way. Isn't the point of being a assassin being able to get a clean kill without being seen?    Assassincreed doesn't fit the description of a stealth game, hell stealth doesn't really existed in this game the first place. its hard to tell where this game fits in maybe in a action adventure type style. but other then that i suggest that you rent this game first before you buy it.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[When I saw the first gameplay of Assassin's Creed, I was so excited that I was minutes away from soiling myself. I bought the game as soon as I could, and boy was I glad that I'd bought the game. Why? 'Cause it's fucking wonderful, that's why! The graphics are fantastic, the music is epic and the feeling you get the first time you scale a building is beyond imagination. Suffice to say, after playing it for 5 hours I was happier than a kitty chasing a leaky cow. It's a shame, then, that this feeling didn't last throughout the game. You see, after the fourth assassination or so, you start to suspect the obvious: There is no variety.This is, according to me, the game's one and only flaw. After doing the same mission over and over again, it gets old. Real old. So old, in fact, that you just ignore the missions and roam free in the cities, stealth-assassinating everyone in your way. Had it not been for the compelling story, we'd all been stuck between the fourth and fifth assassination, just running around and acting like god-like pricks with hidden blades. It is fortunate, then, that the story is compelling. It's so compelling, in fact, that I doubt that anyone who has the first game won't buy the second game. Still, I think you should give Assassin's Creed a try, especially now when it's so cheap. The lack of variety is a shame, especially since the rest of the game is mind-blowingly good. It isn't that bad, however, and if you're a tolerant person you won't even notice it.  So if you like history and sliting Medieval-guys' throats, then this is the game for you. If not...well, you'd still enjoy it. Kinda.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed is a third-person, Third Crusades-inspired, conspiracy-laden, sandbox-styled, stealth-oriented, action-filled, anti-religious, virtual reality simulating, preachy adventure game. As far as I can tell, Assassin’s Creed is the first third-person, Third Crusades-inspired, conspiracy-laden, sandbox-styled, stealth-oriented, action-filled, anti-religious, virtual reality simulating, preachy adventure game ever made, so I’ll give the game credit for that. We don’t get too many games with twenty million dollar budgets that don’t involve heavily armoured muscular men fighting aliens in space.  You play as Desmond, an ordinary human being with tight jeans and such superpowers as “walk gingerly” and “lie down here.” He’s been kidnapped by an unknown organization and forced to use his horizontal powers to lay inside a strange contraption called an “Animus.” This machine is used to analyze the “genetic memory” of Desmond’s ancestor while the rest of the world rolls their eyes during the mad scientist guy’s explanation of the technology.  So the third person stealth/action parts of the game are spent playing as Desmond’s great, great, grandassassinfather Altair. He shamed his clan by showing independent thought during a mission and must regain his honour by way of displaying great obedience in killing nine important targets. The dual futuristic/medieval timepiece settings work surprisingly well together. The virtual reality slant, while anything but a surprise to anyone that saw that original E3 trailer, makes a clever alibi for invisible walls, HUDs, lock-on targeting, restarting a level and other video game-isms that wouldn’t make sense in 1190. Assassin’s Creed also excels at leeching off the  without feeling too overbearing. King Richard I makes a cameo appearance from 800 years beyond the grave to monologue his beliefs and be conspired against by the rest of the damn game. And there’s a strong aura of authenticity, from the angry lepers to angry guards to angry homeless people to angry preachers that makes the player feel like they’re in  being discriminated against. Then Altair opens his mouth, speaks perfect English and gives immersion a dropkick. He speaks perfect, usually emotionless English, as if a translator is speaking for him for a documentary. For all I know, that may have been the intended effect. As the story unfolds, the conspiracy(s?) begin to unravel and I felt myself getting intrigued. I began to think to myself “so here’s a story about warring factions with different philosophical beliefs. There’s a potential for something great here.” But as the game reached the final chapters, the plot twist that I anticipated and dreaded would happen did happen. Where I was wrong in predicting the storyline, however, was that the clashing moralities theme gets thrown asunder for the less intriguing twist of an evil madman using a powerful tool to achieve world domination. Yawn. Oh, and there’s something about religious stories being an illusion, which feels a bit too much like an attempt to earn Da Vinci Code-like notoriety in the press. Controversy that never quite picked up in the media or reached the ears of any conservative groups, for better or worse.  Perhaps this is due to the sheer labour that any player of Assassin’s Creed must go through to reach those potentially controversial bits.  Each assassination follows a strict routine. First, your leader gives you a stern chastising for questioning him. Then you have to walk down your hillside fortress and make your way to a large virtual space known simply as “the .” This “” consists of large, empty fields filled with horses to jack and scout towers to climb. The distance between each destination is fairly long, and the paths are filled with guards that take exception to speedy horse riding. This brings up one of the game’s strange quirks; speed is a grave crime punishable by death. If you ride with a speed faster than “inching forward as not to chip your horse’s shoes”, the guards will instantly assume that you are up to some kind of vile shenanigans and engage in pursuit. Late for a meeting? Need to use the bidet? Giving birth? Saladin won’t forgive any of these excuses for daring to ride a horse with any kind of haste. Fortunately, only a handful of missions force the navigation of this enigmatic “”. With all due respect to the programmers that poured a great deal of love and labour modeling this field, I can’t help but feel like their time was wasted and the game would have actually benefited by just letting the player jump straight to the desired city.  Once you enter either Acre,  or , you must first enter an Assassin Bureau to be further chastised by the local wiseman. Then one enters the “investigation” stage. Each city is an open sandbox, with more actual sand than any other so-called “sandbox games” on mere virtue of particle effects. Altair has the freedom to climb any building, pimpslap any hobo and break any vase. It’s a mostly immersive game world that brims with life, despite the excessive repeating of voice samples from homeless people insisting that I don’t understand how poor they are. (I do understand, I just come from a time where your pushy panhandling would get your raggedy ass arrested. If you want change, have a clever sign like “need money for weed.”) But don’t mistake sandbox freedom with sandbox fun. Harming the innocent will drain your health, under the guise that you’re “breaking the Creed.” And just like in the , having the audacity to move faster than a gentle walk will net the attention of angry guards, especially in later missions. I’m sorry Ubi Soft, I’m sorry that instant-gratification video games and Youtube have shot my attention span to a point where I’d like to get to my next objective a little quicker than an hour. The only walking pace that won’t result in an army of angry crusaders up the ass is to hold the A button, hold your hands in prayer and make baby steps forward. Is the only way to avoid aggravating guards to pray to your god? I know the game has the opening message of “this game was made by a multi-cultural staff of different beliefs”, but do they all discriminate against Atheism that badly?    The next three steps in what feels like the 12-step program for rehabilitating your main victim away from life are as follows: First you must find a predetermined, very tall building to climb so that Altair can soak in the view. The climbing controls are very intuitive and will have Altair climbing in the direction you want him to…about 70% of the time. In reaching these high peaks, the investigation missions start appearing on the map. Altair must accomplish these missions to get information on his target. These can include picking a pocket, fistfighting a loudmouth, eavesdropping in on a conversation, stealth killing a few guards or running an obstacle course of flags. Also, there are about ten citizens per city being harassed by guards for REASONS THAT MUST NOT BE THEIR FAULT, and rescuing them will yield a group of vigilantes or priests that support your murderous cause. On my first run through Murder Rehab, I was so intrigued by the novelty of being an Assassin doing his own dirty work that I actually accomplished all of six investigation and ten-odd rescue missions without asking questions. After collecting the information necessary, the condescending wiseman gave me permission to stick my hidden sword down another man’s throat. That sounded wrong.  The problem with Assassin’s Creed is that all of the “assassinations” follow this same format. Enter a city, do the exact same missions over again, kill your target, move on. And there’s up to 12 civilian missions and 6 information missions per level, plus 100 optional “flags” throughout each city to collect. So to deliver what would otherwise be the final summary statement in a review halfway in the review, Assassin’s Creed is a good game to buy if you want to explore 12 century  without having to play an actual video game, or you’re just an Xbox Live Achievement-hoarding freak. But if you enjoy dynamic gameplay experiences that change and become more enjoyable over time, well Assassin’s Creed feels like 6-10 hours wasted. And adding to the sense of repetition, you can’t skip any cutscenes. Fail any given mission, and expect to sit through the pre-mission conversation about the madness of the kings before getting a second shot.  On a brighter note, once you’ve been given a 1190s license to kill, the actual assassinations are somewhat interesting. Some of them involve large structures, many guards and can demand a bit of thinking when it comes to devising a unique approach to a kill. Think Hitman, or at least Hitman-lite. The “kill your way in” approach works too sometimes, but there’s more grace in going in unnoticed and pouncing an unsuspecting religious leader rather than whip him around with your sword. In another of those moments that wouldn’t make sense if not for this whole Virtual Reality balderdash, each victim will begin to soliloquize his motivations even after you’ve deepthroated them with a dagger. Jade Raymond seems bent to make sure the player views as many speeches, monologues, gossips, public speaking and other forms of small talk as possible. After your victim has given their final speech, many guards will begin to give chase and you’ll have to either lose or slay them before returning to your wiseman to complete the mission.  If you choose fight over flight, the swordplay isn’t particularly deep but it’s sufficient. Based on timing button presses, Altair blocks or counters enemy attacks from all directions while delivering strikes of its own. It gets tiring fast, but being that Assassin’s Creed should be a game about stealth, resorting to combat as a punishment would otherwise be a fine idea in my books. On to the flight-side of the issue, running from the guards can be the most exhilarating aspect of the entire game. Trying to outrun and psyche out pursuing guards, find a pre-determined stack of hay or box or…bench, to hide in, it takes a lot of effort to elude the guards but a well-executed escape is a rewarding feeling. Unfortunately, during later missions, a guard sitting outside your next investigation objective may take offense to the way you’re walking faster than 10 paces a minute and will instantly alert his friends, needlessly slowing your progress in the actual game.  And going back to my earlier point about combat being a viable punishment for poor stealth, well…I can’t use that argument for Assassin’s Creed actually. The last few missions consist of an annoying series of forced battles with what feels like all opposing sides of the Crusades. I often felt as if Assassin’s Creed was progressively getting worse and worse as I further played it.    And after Altair has single-handedly fought all the warring armies in the Crusades and slays his final target, the game ends with cruel abruptness and the most obnoxious of cliffhangers. As if the game slaps you in the face and demands you pay another $70 to get any form of resolution out of this mess. Few plot ends are tied, many mysteries are created, and the game attempts to throw in numerous viral messages meant for message board posters to speculate on while they wait two years…TWO YEARS, for the next game. But rather than leaving me interested in decoding the messages, the ending (or lack thereof) killed much of my interest in the upcoming Assassin’s Creed 2. It’s already been announced that, just like every single damned new franchise of this console generation, Assassin’s Creed is intended to be a trilogy, and I have no interest having more unopened plot threads generated in the next game and having to wait another two years to seek any sense of closure. I don’t mind so many franchises being planned as lengthy, multi-game epics, so long as any one game leaves me feeling like my time wasn’t wasted. Mass Effect left the player feeling satisfied with his or her work, all the while opening up enough intrigue for an impending sequel. Assassin’s Creed leaves the player feeling ripped off, like all that time spying and pickpocketing was but for a mere couple of cryptic messages. As a result, I feel the best advice I can give gamers is to read plot spoilers on the internet, wait another two years and only play Assassin’s Creed 3.  And speaking of 3s, this game gets 3 stars.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Developer – Ubisoft Publisher – Ubisoft Platforms – PC (Steam or Disc)  Release – 11/05/08 You know a games going to be good when it puts a warning label when its booted up. Assassin’s Creed a nice disclaimer mentioning the game is made by a multicultural team of different faiths. Translated it says “We can be as racist or stereotypical as we want because we are only insulting ourselves”  Assassin’s Creed is completely crazy. The story is all about a bartender called Desmond in the future who may or may not be an Assassin and has also been kidnapped. But at the same time, its all about his ancestor Altair, an assassin in the times of the Third Crusade who goes round stabbing anyone who he is told to by his master. This mismash is explained by the fact a machine called the Animus allows someone to experience their ancestors memories due to storing them in the DNA. The story is crazy but it actually becomes much better later on when Desmond starts looking for an escape. To be honest you don’t play Assassin’s Creed for its story. You play instead play for its gameplay. Assassin’s Creed has the best acrobatics system I have ever seen in any game ever. Instead of having to hammer the jump button like a caffeine addict, you instead hold down a button to switch to high profile mode. This then tells the game to automatically jump, roll, dive or swing depending on the obstacle. Although it seems lazy, it makes many of the chases both look good and play well preventing some of the anger usually associated with jumping around. The main crux of the gameplay is focused around the assassinations. Instead of just giving you all required information, it instead sends you off to find it yourself. Nice idea, but when its the same task for every kill  it gets a bit repetitive. The PC version does include a few extra missions but they are basically more of the same. That said though the actual killings are great fun. Planning it out before jumping off a wall with a wrist mounted blade and stabbing someone in the face. The combat is quite good, though you have to learn how to use counter attacks very quickly if you wish to proceed beyond the first set of missions. Again, like the platforming, it looks great and controls as well.  Its obvious that Ubisoft has put a lot of work into the game engine behind AC. The game looks beautiful and allows some spectacular views over the three cities (Damascus (Arabic), Acre (Christian, but only recently) and Jerusalem (Arabic but about to be invaded)) and gives each its own atmosphere. For example, Acre has just been besieged and so is dark, with an effect reminding me personally of the film Kingdom of Heaven. These effects and visuals give it a blockbuster style effect, which carries over into the audio. I don’t know what it exactly is, but the game sounds exceptionally good. Voices seem especially good, though the quality of the other noises shouldn’t be lessened. It also has a very good system for positioning of sounds, making sound a useful tool for planning your assassination.  However, there are some problems. As said before it is very repetitive. Its also very punishing if you don’t use all the tools available to you. Even worse is the state the PC version was released in. It requires an insanely powerful PC to look its best and is also picky about the hardware it is running on. The list of programs or configurations it has issues with is really, really long. Another flaw is the fact its an obvious console port. The number of clicks and loading screens required to get out of the game, a normally fairly trival task, is so many that the makers actually recommend using Alt-F4 to gain a minigun exit the game. As well as this there are other signs of consoleification, such as the game only displaying in 16:9 leaving most gamers with letterboxing, somewhat ruining the cinematic effect.  All these faults aside, Assassin’s Creed is a game everyone needs to play, either on console or PC. It has so many smart ideas, and shows them in such a stylish presentation that it is enjoyable, though it does become repetitive after a while. It will be great to see what the team do with the feeback of this game in terms of Assassin’s Creed 2  I give Assassin’s Creed: Director’s Edition on PC 80%]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ The gameplay is a great and elegant combination of platforming, stealth and combat.  The stealth is probably the least exciting of the three. When being watched by the guards you just have to walk slowly to not draw attention until you break the line of sight. At the beginning it can be fun to pass near the guards without alarming them, but soon becomes boring and ends up hurting the pace of the game.  Climbing buildings and jumping from one place to another is consistently fun and intuitive. Every surface or structure you think Altair should be able to climb or jump to, he really can. This makes city exploration fluid and captivating, even though there aren't many rewarding things to do.   The combat system is shallow at the beginning and although that issue is gradually corrected as the story progresses, with the addition of some useful abilities, only around half through the game does it becomes truly satisfying. By then, many players will probably be tired of engaging in repetitive sword fights to be able to appreciate its depth and to see that fighting can become enjoyable if you learn how to coordinate your moves in an effective combat strategy.  Because the mission types are small in number and the fighting, at least in the first half of the game, can be a somewhat tedious task, if you play the game for many hours everyday it will surely be a repetitive experience. But if you play it only one hour-per-day in average, the game never stops being fun, because there are various approaches you can take to complete the assassination missions, result of a so well designed control scheme plus the organic interaction Altair has with each building and each person.  The plot isn't particularly interesting but is intriguing enough to keep you moderately curious about what's going to happen next and has some original elements that separate it from other action-adventure stories. On the other hand, it has an abrupt and confusing cliffhanger ending, making the whole story considerably less memorable than it could've been.  The game has a good amount of content, with nearly 20 hours of play-time, in case you just do the minimum required to finish the story. If you're like me and don't like to rush through a game with extremely detailed and historic cities to explore, each one with more than a dozen of citizens to save and many more hidden flags to collect, then it can provide you 30-35 hours of entertainment before the credits role. Probably though, you'll seldom revisit the game in the future.  Some minor visual glitches and a sometimes inconsistent frame-rate hurt the experience a bit. However, apart from those two flaws, the graphics are just fantastic and on par with the best the PS3 has produced. The sound is even better than the graphics, with mind-blowing and helpful sound effects, an appropriate music for each situation and competent voice-work for almost all the characters. Overall, the audio-visual design of the cities is so absorbing, alive and full of details that it almost feels like you really are there.  Ultimately, Assassin's Creed is a fun and immersive Historic Action Adventure game. Every time you enter in the animus machine, it actually feels like you enter a time machine and travel trough time and space, arriving in such historic cities as Jerusalem, Damascus, and Acre in the 12th century. Even though the mission-based structure can be repetitive and the combat isn't exciting at the beginning, if you moderate your gaming sessions it can be an entertaining and intriguing experience.  It's not a sandbox game like Grand Theft Auto (otherwise I wouldn't have bought it), where the main joy comes from causing mayhem by doing crazy things or destroying stuff. But also never tries to be, focusing instead on providing a believable representation of the famous cities as they were nearly a 1000 years ago and on successfully combining platforming, stealth and action. ==============================  SCORE ::::::::::::::::::::::::: ((( 8.5 / 10 ))) - (in a scale of 0.5 increments, without a formula) ============================== Gameplay = = = = = = = = ( 8 ) Graphics = = = = = = = = = ( 9 ) Sound = = = = = = = = = = (10) Value = = = = = = = = ( 8 ) ==============================]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[At its outset Assassin's Creed (AC) promised to be everything I could want in a game. A large world in a fairly uncommon setting, an interesting story, amazing AI, and an exciting blend of game play elements.  The animation is excellent and you can almost feel every kill. The sheer size of the cities and the amount of NPCs inside them are staggering. AC also offers the best horse riding game play behind Shadow of the Colussus and some very interesting crowd navigation game play dynamics.AC succeeds in many regards by being one of the most detailed games produced to date. The large cities bustling with NPCs, the detailed way that weapons appear on Altair, the small pieces of hay left behind when he exits a haystack, amazing animations, and a whole host of other little details. The problem lies with the fact that the majority of these details focus solely on the game's graphics leaving the AI, audio, and actual game play either uneven or lacking in quality.The AI works well for the most part with crowds scattering when a fight starts or a corpse is discovered, guards pursuing Altair through the streets and over rooftops, and pursuers taking aim with rocks when you climb a structure to escape. The AI can just as easily embarrass itself though with NPC guards repeatedly hopping between the same rooftops , being oblivious to the death of their allies whilst standing only a few feet away, and finally being slaughtered because they insist on taking turns to attack Altair even though he is grossly outnumbered.In the audio department there is some nice voice acting for the main characters and the main plotline. The dialogue of NPCs is not bad either but entirely lacking in variety. You will save citizen upon citizen from being harassed by guards only to hear the same set of thank yous spoken in different dialects.The lack of variety in the audio department is also reflected in ACs game play. The story is told around the assassination of 9 targets by Altair to regain the trust of his mentor and restore his rank within the assassin's guild after a fallout at the beginning of the game. The game has a decent story with intruiging details and twists delivered along the way. This is all fine and well, but the game play does not tie into the story at all. Altair repeats the same basics sets of objectives until an assasination attempts unlocks. The individual activities are enjoyable enough, but after your third pick pocket and fourth back alley interrigation you can really feel the grind. Each successful assasination awards Altair new gear and moves, but this does little to diversify the grind of the actual gameplay. The story does make make the grind worth it though and I'd recommend anyone who starts AC to persist to its end.To summarize I got the impression that AC was  a game with a truck load of ambition that tried to pull it all along but got crushed under the load. With more time to diversify aspects like the NPC dialogue and game play options it could've been something truly special. All that potential now firmly lies with its soon-to-be-released sequel and to say I'm excited about AC2 would be an understatement. ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed is a bold adventure that spans back to the time of the Crusades. You'll play dual characters throughout the game, the first being Desmond who is kidnapped by a mysterious corporation and proceeds to subject him to a device called an Animus that is able to read his genetic memories. The second character is Altaïr -- the long-lost relative of present day Desmond and whose life is so interesting to this corporation. The plotline is serviceable if a little extraordinary.The graphics are pretty, the sound is superb and the voice acting is convincing (all except for Altaïr who delivers every line with the enthusiasm of a DMV employee forced to work over-time). Where AC ultimately comes up short is in its execution (no pun intended) of gameplay as you are consistently tasked with doing the same exact side missions that lead up to each assassination target in each of the game's wonderfully recreated ancient cities of Acre, Damascus and JerusalemUbisoft creates such a rich and vibrant world and inhabits that world with a badass protagonist, but they hamper down this feeling of badassery by throwing in a bunch of repetitive and monotonous side missions. While it is not necessary to complete all these missions before you can assassinate your primary target, by ignoring them you are severely cutting short your gameplay experience. Not to mention the finale turns into an all out brawl that makes the entire premise of the game seem sort of moot. Overall, the game is a competent piece of work that just needs a little more variety to flesh it out.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[ Story (9.5/10): I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. The development team clearly put a ton of research and thought into the story, recreating accurate cities, historical personages, and giving you a highly stylized vision of life in the Levant during the age of the Crusades.In particular, the story does a surprisingly good job of adding a moral element to the proceedings. Unlike in a lot of role-playing games, where ""morality"" just means making either a clearly good or clearly bad decision, Assassin's Creed introduces moral questions through the assassinations themselves. After each one, you and the target have a sort of deathbed confession scene in which he attempts to justify his actions. It lends a moral ambiguity to your actions (well, considering you just killed them, I suppose it's ever-present) and leads you to question the wisdom of your missions.The highly-publicized and hence spoiled ""twist"" in the game actually performed its function well in the game, at least in my opinion, lending an air of modern conspiracy and urgency to ancient events.The story does end on something of a cliffhanger, setting up the anticipated sequels in the planned trilogy.Gameplay (7.5/10): The majority of Assassin's Creed consists of a formula: reach a city, enter one of the regions (Poor, Rich or Middle-Class districts), scout the city from various vantage points that you climb, and then complete the missions you find from each vantage point. The missions are quite simple, consisting of interrogation, pickpocketing or eavesdropping, which all function as sort of chores to do before you get to the good stuff.By this, of course, I mean the actual assassination. And this part is usually riveting. After gathering intel (by doing three of the six possible missions in a given region), you have enough information to seek out your target and kill him. After slaying him, you then flee from your pursuers before repeating the process. All in all, you kill nine or ten people.The control mechanics of Assassin's Creed make just exploring the city a blast. The method they invented to control climbing and free-running is amazing and quite fluid after you get used to it, which takes an hour.Combat, however, is a little bit boring because it's too easy. All you do is block until your opponent lunges forward, then you hit the counter button and pull off a counter attack. Basically, they cannot hurt you while blocking, so you are nearly invincible in combat and can pick your spots to kill them at your leisure.Presentation (9.5/10): Assassin's Creed is an intensely beautiful game, with massive cities and breathtaking vistas. Sound is also excellent throughout, with voice-acting from such notables as Kristen Bell (whose character is actually clearly modeled after her). The one criticism is that the character models themselves don't look all that great, with odd, flat faces that seem unconvincing when expressing emotion.Overall, I think Assassin's Creed is a strong game but by no means a perfect one. The gameplay has several serious flaws, but compensates with many thrilling moments. Nonetheless, even while accomplishing the most mundane tasks, one is still compelled by the excellent story and entranced by the stellar production values.]]>"

Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[At first glance, Assassins creed is a much better looking version of prince of persia: sands of time. But once you play it you will realise that it's much more then a prince of persia- splinter cell combo. It is in fact a great game, but repetition makes it a hit or miss type of experience. I really enjoyed this game, it is gorgeous and VERY detailed, not only from a technical point of view, but also from a gameplay point of view. Jumping from one rooftop to another can be very exciting, but also downright annoying all at the same time.  And the games combat is a bit too easy . I think the reason for these annoyances comes from the repetitive nature of the game. The formula for Assassins creed is as follows, investigate, report and kill. And it's that very formula that is the source of all the games problems. Aside from that, this game is a must play. The story is good ( though it will leave you wanting more ) the voice acting is superb and as I've said before this game looks stellar. Overall I think it's worth playing, in fact if you take your time with it and don't do more then one, maybe two missions in one sitting, you'll have a great time with it.  ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[  Nothing can quite describe Assassin`s creed. Its beautiful visuals, its cities which are bristling with life, danger, and corruption, and its engaging combat. You play as Altair, a trained assassin who`s rank stripped from him and forced to earn it back by killing nine important people to stop their corruption.   Altair has a wide variety of weapons in his arsenal. He has an hidden blade, that can kill enemies with great speed and ease whilst being unnoticed. A sword, which is the main weapon of choice when battling head on into a battle. A dagger that performs bloody counters that usually end up in instant kills. He also has throwing knives, which can dispatch enemies from a distance.    Altair is not only trained to fight however. He could climb almost every building in assassin`s creed, taking hold of ledges, cracks in the walls, bricks, and any other sort of objects that seem climbable. This is something brilliantly pulled off by Ubisoft, allowing the player to explore the urban cities in ways other free roaming games like the grand theft auto series have not.    The controls in this game are fluid and easy to use. They do not feel clunky in any way and its just amazing how Altair climbs and freeruns in the city while your just pressing a WASD button.The goal of each mission in this game is to assassinate a person. To locate the person you must assassinate, you must go around the city and investigate. When you have completed the desired amount of investigations, the location of the target you must assassinate will appear on your GPS. This is however assassin`s creed greatest downfall, its investigations. To locate informers that give you information on your target, you must go and climb towers to get your GPS updated with  the location of them. By the time you finish the game, you probably climbed towers too many times to count. When you finally find the informers, you would think that things would get less repetitive, but that is not the case. The informers you find during the game will give you the same old missions to do to get information out of them. Go assassinate 5 of these, get all 16 flags under three minutes, and so on. At the end of an investigation process, you will be tasked to kill a major target. When you kill the target, there will always be a brief cutscene that is very interesting.   Assassin`s creed is a good game, no doubt about that, but if Ubisoft added more diversity in investigation missions to Assassin`s creed, then it would have lived up to it`s potential. The verdict: Story: 8  Graphics: 9.5 Gameplay: 8.5 Sound: 8.5 Overall: 8.5 (not an average)]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Played Through in Fall 2009. So…there’s this guy who…likes to SHANK a fool or two...and when he’s not playing hopscotch across the rooftops of Old Jerusalem, he’s popping in and out of the memory of his latest descendent from the future who’s trying to shack up with Kristen Bell…. a weird rubbery looking Kristen Bell, but hey, who am I to playa hate... Assassin’s Creed impressed me. It even got under my skin a little bit…in a good way. I went into this game with a vague understand of its’ FAULTS: Repetitive Game-play, Repetitive Voice Acting, Dull A.I. and so on. But despite all of these faults I found Assassin’s Creed to be absurdly satisfying not ONLY to the eye, but also to the touch. Maybe I’m a sucker for Atmosphere in a game, but if developers go out of their way to create beautiful lush environments that feel truly alive, I can’t help but look past the holes in the game play. When I first peered over the ledge and saw the City of Damascus from afar, and the sun silhouetted my profile while the soundtrack kicked in…I practically GASPED. Breathing in the Art Direction of this game was worth every monotonous side quest and annoying beggar lady. For me at least. I actually STOPPED playing this game half way in and spent close to a total of 6 HOURS researching all Nine Crusades and the conquests of King Richard as well as Saladin . Few games have inspired me in such a way and by doing so, it made me appreciate the historical context of the Assassin‘s World even more. It’s so daring for media entertainment to throw in the complex, political and heated religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam into one pot and pull it off which a good amount of respect and honesty. Granted I think the Vision of this game is probably better than the game itself, but it’s a Vision I don’t mind seeing for more iterations and blades in dudes faces to come.    ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[Great game, but after awhile it gets pretty boring. Its the same stuff over and over again but in different towns. I love the way you can throw daggers, have special moves and much more. Also I love how you can do a silent assassination i have played many games hoping that it was possible. I hope to see more out of Assassin's Creed two. But all in all good game. Just looking for a little more out of it.]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[This game is as soulless and unfun. It is repetitive, shallow, and frequent cut scenes only highlight the unlikable characters.  Still curious? Borrow the game and complete the first assassination mission. I'll wait. Done? Okay, you've now seen everything the game has to offer. Did you like that long ride to the first city? Did you love the investigations (sit on a bench and listen overhear, walk real slow and press b to pick pocket)? Are you thrilled at the thought of climbing up 10 view points per city district? Then you are in luck because you'll be doing all of those things over and over again. Completed all of the cities? Don't fret, you'll be sent back to EACH city two more times (poor, merchant, and rich districts). There might be more stuff after that, but I never got past clearing the second district in the 3rd city. Or was that the 3rd district in the second city? I have no idea, its all the exact same in both game play and story. (edit: I did eventually finish the game, I relied on the hidden blade counter to get through all the late game combat, no change in my score or review.) The two stars are for the pretty graphics and occasionally interesting combat.    ]]>"
Assassin'creed,"<![CDATA[""Assassin's Creed"" is an interesting game... by that, I don't mean interesting in terms of story (although the story is pretty good), but rather in terms of how you look at it. On one hand, you've got this great period-piece videogame with a strange and different story, and some fairly fun and fluid platforming and combat skills. On the other hand, you've got a game that has got to be the poster child for repititious games. Throughout the entire game, with the small exceptions of the beginning and the end, it's the exact same mission structure for nine long assassinations; talk to Maysaf, go to the town, talk to the bureau head, investigate your target, talk to the bureau head again, kill your target, talk to the bureau head once more, then go back to Maysaf. It's like that throughout the entire game... Now, if you were to tell someone those details about Ubisoft's ""Assassin's Creed"", that person probably wouldn't be too interested in playing it. However, that would be doing this beautiful-looking game a big dis-service. There's nothing wrong with repitition if the the repetitive gameplay is fun. And in ""Assassin's Creed"", it is fun. Now, while some may disagree that it's stops halfway through due to the repitition, others will agree with me in saying; ""Assassin's Creed"" is an all & out great game with fun gameplay, an intriguing storyline, beautiful visuals, and a fantastic physics engine. A must-play for people who don't whine about repitition.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[    Twice the hidden blades, twice the fun?  The first Assassin's Creed game was quite polarizing. There were plenty of good things to be said about the free running, the graphics, and the quality of the settings. The chief drawbacks that were stated were the repetitive, gamey aspect of the side quests that were required in between assassinations. Assassin's Creed 2 has completely fixed that aspect. With that being said, does that make it an instantly better game than the first? Yes... And no.The sequel has exactly the same strengths as the first game. The set pieces are simply amazing. Florence and Venice feel incredibly real and you'll spend the majority of your time there. Gone are the lengthy, annoying sequences requiring you to ride between cities on horseback. Ubisoft has also incorporated a fast travel ""caravan"" system that can put you immediately where you want to go for a small cost. If you do choose to travel by horse, the landscapes are much more compact and much more interesting than they were in the first game. The problems of Assassin's Creed regarding lengthy traveling have been almost completely fixed in this game, and the pacing of the game is helped a great deal because of it. The soundtrack is beautifully composed and helps out quite a bit. I didn't remember it being as much of a factor in the first game, but it really adds a great deal to the feel. The soundtrack is at its best when it's dark and brooding, such as when you're dungeon crawling in search of the assassins' tombs.The cities themselves are still the single biggest strength of the game and are largely unchanged from the first installment. They're beautifully constructed and quite true to history. They're also packed with people and they feel just as living and breathing as Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem did in the first game. The scale of the cities is amazing, and it really makes the building-climbing platforming rewarding when you're sitting atop a tower peering over a bustling landscape below you. The graphics are just as strong as the first game. The building textures all look great up close and the character models are equally good.There are several improvements over the first game to be had. Side missions in this game are greatly improved from the previous game. They've incorporated a great deal more variety, are spread further apart, and in general just feel a whole lot less gamey and repetitive. You'll do a lot more actual assassinating in this game as you can collect contracts from chicken coops almost limitlessly. There are also beat-'em-up missions, courier missions, races, and more. It all feels much more applicable to the reality of the game and the strict requirement of the side quests has been all but removed. For the most part they serve only as an additional way to earn money. Aside from the improvements, there is an entirely new level of customization added to this game that was absent from the first game.You can now purchase several different types of armor, swords, daggers, health pouches, and more. One of the new aspects that I greatly enjoyed was the new dye system. Sick of the same old white assassin's costume? Visit a tailor. There are a large amount of different dye options, varying from locale to locale, but each of them are interesting and do a lot to freshen up the game. Gone are the piles of collectible flags from the first game, replaced by a significantly different quantity of collectible items such as feathers for your brother and mother, assassin's seals to unlock a special armor, symbols to scan that engage you in an interesting (and slightly creepy) minigame, and codex pages to give you new equipment. All of the collectibles may seem a bit daunting at first, but it begins to become more manageable once you grasp where to find each of them and which rewards you get for each collectible. Most importantly is the fact that all of these collectibles are interesting and relevant to the game -- not generic and boring like the flags of the first Assassin's Creed.The single best addition, though, has to be the acquisition of a stronghold and your ability to increase its worth by investing money into shops, mines, brothels, and more. It became one of my driving forces behind playing the game, and I was soon dumping all of the money that I earned back into my stronghold in order to improve its worth. This isn't without reward, either. The more your stronghold is worth, the more people will stop by to visit mid-journey, and the more they'll spend on your various points of interest. You make a certain portion of money every twenty minutes, which is deposited into the chest in the architecture room of your villa. This also ties back to the collectibles, which increase the value of your stronghold as well. It's incredibly enjoyable and was one of the brightest points of the game for me.Unfortunately Assassin's Creed 2 isn't without its faults. Ezio's character development is interesting and it does feel as if he's changed significantly by the end of the game, but I still didn't really feel enthralled by him as a character. The story is very political and can be a bit tough to follow in the beginning if you don't have much of an interest in history. But it picks up towards the middle and becomes very engaging for the rest of the game. The worst factor of the game for me was something that I loved about the first game: the platforming and free running. When it's good, it's great, but when it's bad, it's downright frustrating and nearly caused me to turn off my console at times.Attempting to free run with speed is inevitably difficult and there are many times when you'll be chasing somebody with the camera locked and inadvertently begin to scale the wrong wall or structure, causing you to lose your target. This is far too easy to do and can be incredibly frustrating. It led to me all but totally bypassing any of the side missions that required a race or a chase sequence. This also leads to the chase sequences being purely trial and error -- mostly error -- and very unenjoyable. There are also occasions while scaling when Ezio would inexplicably stop moving in the direction that I was climbing, causing me to think that I couldn't continue any further that way. Later on I'd realize that Ezio sometimes simply stops for no reason and just cranes his head in that direction as if to say that it wasn't possible to continue climbing in that direction even though there is indeed to possibility to continue. Only letting go of the left control stick and then once again moving it to the direction would cause him to continue. It's mind-boggling as to why he does this, and incredibly frustrating when you're attempting to move quickly. More than one time it caused me to attempt to jump which resulted in my untimely death and a string of curses erupting from me and directed at Ezio's onscreen corpse. As an extension of this, it's also far too easy to jump in the wrong direction during a climb, and several times the camera would crane to show me an object to jump to which would result in my attempting the jump several times and missing it each time until I decided to just move on and forget about it. These factors combined with the lack of a quick ""restart from checkpoint"" option greatly diminished (if not totally removed) any of my enjoyment from these types of sequences. This all came to a head for me when I spent nearly a half an hour removing several archers from surrounding towers in order to get to my target, made my way all the way up the main tower with the objective of hanging onto the edge and pulling the guards over. Ezio inexplicably climbs up over the top of the edge, and I'm sent falling to my death as a guard immediately pushes me back over. The lack of adequate checkpoints now forces me to start the entire mission over. Thirty minutes of gameplay lost due to poor controls is not an experience that I enjoy in my video games. These types of control-oriented platforming and free running issues are indicative of a system that hasn't aged very well, as I don't remember having this many problems with the first game and the system has remained largely unchanged.Combat returns largely unchanged from the first game. It's still based mostly on countering, and it feels alright in general but has a number of inherent issues. Performing a nice counter is incredibly enjoyable, as are the killing sequences that follow. Disarming is another aspect of combat that's incredibly fun, and when I was involved in minor encounters with guards I often wouldn't draw a weapon at all in favor of just disarming a guard and taking his. There are a few bugs here that diminish the experience much like there are in the free running system. There are times when Ezio will become stuck in an animation, such as stumbling, when he comes into contact with a wall, allowing the guards to continue to beat on you until you die. The camera is also a major issue. It will attempt to find the right angle when battling, but gets caught inside and behind walls and ceilings often when you're doing combat in a closed-in area. These issues were enough to damage what was a genuinely fun combat system for me at times. The Good: Nearly every drawback of the first game has been improved upon. Superb graphics. Fabulous, brooding soundtrack. Living, breathing cities and landscapes that really make 15th century Italy feel authentic. When platforming works, it's spectacular. Meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. Armor management, weapon management, new costumes, build-your-own-stronghold additions all designed well and addictive.  The Bad: Free running control has aged poorly and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly, making races and chase sequences an annoyance. Ezio doesn't always go where you want him to. Chase sequences are purely trial and error. Bugs in general are a big problem. Camera is a massive pain during battle sequences. No quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints only make existing problems worse.  Final Verdict: There are plenty of nice things included in the package here, but the drawbacks could have been addressed with some more play-testing and tweaking from Ubisoft to make this a far better game. When it's good, it's fantastic, but when it's bad, this game is downright infuriating to play. I had a very love-hate relationship with Assassin's Creed. There were times when I marveled at how good it was, but there were also several moments that saw me turn my system off in utter frustration rather than continue playing the game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,<![CDATA[ The first Assassin's Creed was an amazing experiance from start to finish.  Repetative gameplay aside the intriguing story really pulled you in.  AC2 has that same high quality story but with even better gameplay making it superior to it's predecesor in every way.  There's lots to do as you run around Renesance Italy killing dudes and ultimatly trying to restory your families lost honor. If you like stealth games and love EPIC mind-blowing storylines then you should buy this game!]]>
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed II is the same game as Assassin's Creed at heart, but every complaint has been answered. No more long speeches after assassinations, no more tedious conversations at the beginning of every level, and the main character, Ezio, is much deeper than Altair was.   The combat system has been drastically improved, giving Altair not only the ability to buy new weapons, but to take them from the enemy and proceed to pummel or stab them to death with it.  The only qualm I have with it is that it's incredibly buggy*. I've fallen through walls, the camera sometimes shoots off into roads that I am not on, and the enemy AI, while greatly improved from the last game, is still a little slow. They'll chase you off of a roof and die when they hit the ground. They also cannot swim, but I suppose that makes sense seeing how much armor they wear.  Overall the game is fantastic. I can't find any reason why someone should not buy this game other than if you just don't like the genre.  *Keep in mind that I played the launch version, so patches have yet to be released as of the time that I wrote this review.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  ProsVery good looking game.More interesting side quests and other assorted diversions than the first game.Solid game play.Good at handing out achivement points, if that's your kind of thing.  ConsSide quests are arguably more fun than the main storyline.Game sometimes misinterprets which direction you intended on jumping. That's bad.Iffy looking facial animation. Assassins Creed 2 is a very good sequel.It takes the foundations of the first game and builds upon them nicely.You play as Desmond Miles who in the last game found out he was an an Assassin and then used a  trippy machine called an Animus to relive the life of one of his Ancestors.The game does an okay job of explaining some of this beforehand.Well now he's being strapped into the  trippy machine to relive the memories of one of his other Ancestors,   Ezio  Auditore - whose father and brothers were killed and naturally he wants revenge and along the way learns the skills he needs to be a master assassin.Assassins Creed 2 makes killing dudes fun and provides a good variety of weapons and other bits and bobs from dual wielded wrist blades to maces.  Ezio  proves to be quite a versatile fighter.He can use the dual blades to sneak up and take out a pair of enemies at once, unarmed he can disarm his foes and use his weapons to their advantage, eventually you'll  acquire a pistol.As with the original, most of the non-stealth based violence revolves around the use of counter attacks or in the event that a foe is a bit tougher then your average grunt, weakening him so you can get the counter attack. You'd think this would get repetitive but taking on a bunch of bad guys, countering them and picking them off looks and feels  immensely satisfying.The game in general looks pretty good, really.The  environments as with the first game are it's strongest suit.There are three main cities in the game and a couple of other areas and they all look  gorgeous and you'll get to know them quite intimately as you climb and leap all over the  environments.The free running stuff is a tad more satisfying this time, mostly because  Ezio  proves to be quicker then Altair was. A few games since Assassins Creed have done the free running thing and it's always been a fun way to get around the  environments, but I don't think it's ever looked as right as it does in the Assassins Creed series, though occasionally the game will misinterpret which direction you intended on leaping - possibly causing you to  plummet to your death.Like the first game, when you free run you tend to gravitate toward climbable, walkable, scalable,  swingable surfaces so mistakes are few and far between but it sucks to be doing well and have that occasion come up where the game does you wrong and you wind up dead.The character models aren't too bad, though facial animation is a tad awful. Especially on Lucy.Side quests this time around are more interesting. Perhaps more so then the actual missions.In the Assassination Contracts specifically it imposes more interesting restrictions and requirements for getting your kill than any quest in the main story line does.In addition to  Assassinating guys you also get  courier missions, races and beating up  adulterous husbands. Races aside these are a good deal of fun.I don't have a tonne else to say about the game.I enjoyed it. I think it corrects some of the things that were wrong with the first game and improves upon the things that weren't, making for a great and satisfying experience. 4/5]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ I was going into Assassin's Creed II with the little hope that Ubisoft really learnt from the mistakes the made in the first game. I was wrong. They did not only learn from the mistakes, they pushed AC2 into a whole different league.     My biggest complaint with AC1 was the main character. Altair never felt like a real human being, his whole background remained in the shadows. It was impossible for me to relate to him. Ezio in AC2 is a huge step forward in that regard. He is a fleshed out character, you accompany him from the age of 17 even before he is an assassin. The story that is told around Ezio draws me in much more than the first one, the relationships he has are believable, even funny at some points.  The game mechanics have been improved, too. I got frustrated in AC1 pretty fast, especially about the behaviour of the guards. At some point it was nearly impossible to go from point A to point B without being attacked. The notoriety system in AC2 solves this problem. If you are notorious you can kill certain officials to reduce your 'wanted level' or bribe heralds or remove wanted posters from the walls. If you have to fight, it is fun. It still relies heavily on counter-attacks, but the option to disarm your enemy feels good and overall the fights have a better feel to it.  The game world is stunning. The visuals might have their flaws, like some bad textures and some fog in the distance, but the realism if you compare the cities with its real-world counterparts is astonishing. If you like to you can even learn a thing or two about most of the landmarks by browsing the games extensive database.   AC2 is a great game, if you liked the first one you will love this. And if you did not like the first one, you may still like this sequel. For me the game is on par with my favourite games this year, Batman: Arkham Asylum and Uncharted 2.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[So. First off, I loved the original  Assassin's Creed, and while the original was bogged down by a slightly confusing story and some gameplay issues,  Ubisoft Montreal seems to have studied the feedback from players worldwide. The resulting sequel is a game improved on nearly every level possible, and highly entertaining overall. The Good   Desmond and Lucy seem to have a thing going on, but it is so painfully understated that you start to wonder why it's even there.I won't get into too much explaining of the plot (you can just check the GiantBomb page for that sort of thing), but I must say that the main storyline is far more engaging than the original was, both outside the Animus and inside it. The sequences with the main protagonist in the present,  Desmond, though still only a small piece of the actual gameplay, play a bigger part in the story, and Desmond himself is no longer reduced to merely being some dude switching between lying in a bed or in an Animus. Even though you only see the Desmond-storyline at brief moments in the game, Ubi has still made an effort to explain what's going on, which is really good to see.  As for the OTHER main protagonist,  Ezio, he is a huge improvement over  Altaïr, whose constant bad-assery left him with even less personality than  Cole McGrath. At the beginning of the game Ezio is charming and witty, and throughout the game we witness as he evolves into a vengeful killer. He speaks with a very heavy accent, which sometimes, surprisingly, makes him sound a bit like  Niko Bellic. Or maybe that's just how I hear all non-American accents? Anyway, Ezio's presence helps drag the player into the game - especially in the beginning, when we follow him as he seeks to avenge his family. Later in the game, however, this effect wears off and how Ezio got from avenging his family to suddenly go on a killing spree all across  Italy could have been explained better.  Though the supporting characters certainly don't lack personality - least of all  Leonardo da Vinci, who comes off as a really nice guy - none of them are involved in the actual gameplay enough to make them seem like anything more than, well, supporting roles.  For the most part Assassin's Creed II is the story of one man. And a lot of guards. Ironically, I ended up feeling more committed to my hired prostitutes and mercenaries than to any of the characters central to the plot, because they were the ones helping me 'in the field'. Ezio, while physically similar to Altaïr, comes off as a much more entertaining protagonist.The main storyline is big. Not  San Andreas-big, but big enough. Actually, it sometimes feels too big and disconnected. The whole 'go here, kill this guy' recipe is repeated far too often, and at one point or another it ends up getting boring. Even for an assassin. Luckily, the game has more side-quests than you can shake a stick at. Finding viewpoints, feathers, treasure chests, as well as playing hitman, bouncer or courier among other things. These could all be golden opportunities for PSN-freaks to go  Trophy-hunting, yet for some strange reason only a few of the Trophies are concerning these side-quests. Most of them you just earn by completing the main storyline. Strange choice indeed...Another side-quest I have to mention is the way you get to rebuild the city of Montereggioni using your own, hard-earned cash. It's an amusing activity as long as it lasts, but if you haven't spent billions of cash on hookers and thieves, you should be able to renovate all of the city very quickly, and that's the end of that. The people and cities of Italy seem truly alive. The models of the average Joes hanging out at the corner drinking beer are simply gorgeous. As goes for the women. Their voicework is equally impressive, as well as quite hilarious at times. When I nimbly jumped from rooftop to rooftop, I could hear comments like a woman complaining how 'that's a man! Not like my Antonio', or a man mumbling to himself 'I guess I should find a way to stay in shape as well...'. The official GiantBomb review complained about recycling of voicework, but frankly, I haven't witnessed that very often (except for ""Aha! You found another one! How exciting"", which you'll probably hear approximately 29 times. You'll see...).  As for the in-game music it is strikingly beautiful and also varied. Each city has different music, but it all comes off as soothing and medieval-tinged ambient. When chasing or being chased, the music switched to subtle 'chasing music', which is actually so good that I sometimes find guards to sucker punch and run away only so I can hear the chasing music again. I haven't experienced that kind of music-gameplay teamwork since I was driving an airboat while being chased by a helicopter in  Half-Life 2. When in the 'secret locations', however, the music makes a total change, and instead becomes eerie dark ambient, which reminds me of the music of  Black Dahlia. And that's a good thing.  The Bad  Now for the negative aspects of this game, and the reasons that it didn't get a higher rating from me. First off, some of the controls in-game are notoriously difficult. This especially comes to show at timed events. Like in the original game, you need to press R1 to run and R1 + X to jump and crawl on walls. Unfortunately, the collision detection between Ezio and walls is fubar, and when jumping from railings or the like, you are often limited to 4 or 5 directions in which you can jump. This often leads to Ezio jumping the exact opposite way of what you want, or sometimes not jumping at all, merely crashing onto the pavement below. When you're free-roaming across the city, this is just a slight annoyance, but when you're fighting to complete time challenges or racing to a closing door or to intercept a fleeing guard inside a dungeon, it becomes a regular destroyer of all the fun. I have been dangerously close to throwing my controller out of the window several times when I almost    reached the lever I needed to push, only to have Ezio suddenly for some inexplicable reason ignore the lever, and instead jump into the water below, meaning a great deal of backtracking and cursing along the way...The buggy controls almost singlehandedly kills the platforming-aspect of the game. Another thing which I must criticize a bit is the plot, which blends sci-fi, Renaissance intrigues, a quest for vengeance, the old Assassin-Templar animosity, Christianity and many other things into a confusing mess of a plot, and by the time you are finished with the main storyline, you probably won't feel much more informed about what exactly is going on than when you started. This makes it all the more tempting to seek out 'glyphs' left by Desmond's predecessor in the Animus. However, this only leads to even more confusing, although some of the mini-games associated with them are actually very entertaining. Lastly, and most critical, Assassin's Creed II seems to drive my PS3 beyond its breaking point. Whether it's bad code or simply the grand scale of the game, I have no idea, but the game has both HUGE frame rate issues at points - especially when rendering the entire city - and a disturbingly great amount of freezes. I've even had the game freeze several times the exact same place. Needless to say, that is NOT acceptable.  I have also had people popping up right in front of me, and environment being rendered painfully choppy, which is strange considering the sheer horsepower of the average PS3. Also, the cooler is on almost all the time, even more so than in games like inFamous or Grand Theft Auto IV, which are also huge. This, along with the strangely low default volume setting, and the inability to change this, means that you'll probably have to crank your speakers way loud in order to get a decent experience. Conclusion In conclusion, Assassin's Creed II is a larger, more diverse and entertaining version of Assassin's Creed. It IS highly entertaining, albeit confusing at times, and were it not for the hardware and control issues, that unfortunately destroys a great deal of the gaming experience, I would not hesitate to call it one of the best games of the year. As it is now, however, it's sadly too buggy. Here's hoping for some kind of patch...    Updated impressions                  (30/11/09) After posting this review, I've had several comments talking about how the Xbox 360 version of this game doesn't seem to suffer from the stability issues mentioned above (and a single comment claiming there is no difference). So I'm assuming that the buggy aspect of this game is restricted to the PS3 version. 360 users will probably want to ignore that aspect of the review.   (12/01/10)I just realized that patch 1.01 is out, supposedly fixing the crashes I've had when 'double assassinating' several times in a row. This  is great news, and you may want to disregard some of the above bitching about technical issues.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I don't think I need to go into the problems the first Assassin's Creed had. Just know that the second game in the franchise addresses nearly all of them.  There's so much to do in this virtual realization of Renaissance Italy and just about all of it is fun. My personal highlight was the Assassin Tombs, which feel like like they were ripped straight out of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Trilogy.  Upgrading your personal Villa is very addictive, and anyone who is into conspiracy theories will love the story. Not to mention there is a pretty crazy final boss that you'll want to tell your friends about.  My only real problems with the game are that climbing doesn't work to well it you're not facing straight towards the object you're trying to climb, collecting feathers feels a little too much like collecting flags, and the game never warns you when you're about to be booted out of the animus. But regardless of those things, anyone who likes the idea of stabbing dudes in the neck with a hidden blade should play this game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[So i just finished the story yesterday and i think it took me 2 days or so, (did alot of treasure hunting so that took some time). And i must say i love it as much, maybe even more, then the first one. It's safe to say that this one is like the first Assasin's Creed but better, and that's what makes this game so fun, that is if you liked the first one.  The story picks up right after the original and makes some things clear that you maybe didn't get at the ending of the first one. Also i like it that now you don't have to spend so much time out of the machine, because it bothered me a little in the first game. As i said it's more of the same like the first one so it's still hella fun jumping and climbing up tall ancient buildings and being a real badass assasin!   This time you get more moves, weapons and A-LOT of more things to do. For example you now have to watch how high your 'wanted level' is (like in GTA) and you can reduce it by tearing down wanted posters, bribing speachmen or killing corrupted politicians (or whatever those guys are). Also you have more side-missions like killing random targets given to you, races, beating up men who have been cheating on there women etc. This means more time to spend in the game so it's all good fun. And instead of the flags from the first game you can now collect feathers that are much easier to find then those weird flags. Also your eagle vision is back (you can now move when it's activated) and this is used mostly to find targets or hidden symbols spreaded around the city's, if you find a symbol, these will start a puzzle and if they are solved you can 'discover the truth' and find out more about the story.  One of the coolest new things imo are the tombes, these are sometimes tricky parcour and puzzle solving area's where you have to get a seal, that's hard to get to most of the time, and with those seals you can unlock the pantser of Altaïr (Which looks awesome btw). The sword of Altaïr is also unlocked and it's the best sword in the game. Now that we are talking about weapons, yes, the double hidden blades kick some serious ass. One of the most fun weapons to use in the game. You can now have a main sword, a dagger, hidden blades, poison, a hidden pistol, smoke bombs and throwing knives, something for everyone! I like the daggers because there fast en give your enemy less chance to attack back.  The enemy's in the game are pretty much the same as in the original only now you have these heavily armored knights who can kick your ass if you don't watch out. Blocking with your sword is pretty useless so you have to disarm them and then put their big weapons against them. It makes the combat against more enemy's pretty fun cause you have to switch tactics from time to time. This time you have some friends at your hand who will help you distract or fight them for you, these in include thieves (they can follow you on buildings or wherever execpt they cannot seem to avoid falling into the water lol) , girls (you know what i mean you frisky dog) and fellow swordsmen.   On the graphics and sound department there's nothing to complain about so it's al good. There are only two things that come up as a little negative and that's the accents of the characters get pretty annoying after a while and sometimes your movement and jumps are a little off so you stumble to your death, but this doesn't happen very often so it's nothing to worry about.  Well there you have it, my thoughts on Assasin's Creed 2, if you get the chance play this game, you will have alot of fun with it, peace out.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I played Assassin's Creed 1 to practically completion, except for all the flags. Assassin's Creed II is a great sequel to the Assassin's Creed story. It takes all the aspects of AC1 and improve them. The aspect that I enjoy the most has to be the ability to buy weapons and armor; it adds a collector feel to the game and excites one to try out their new ""toy."" The city upgrading is an awesome aspect too. I personally put all of my money into the city until it was fully upgraded and the income from the city is really paying off. The combat has gotten better as well with the different weapon types, more weapons, counters, and disarms. I enjoy that there is more of a story to the game with side quests that actually lead to rewards. An aspect which I don't like is that sometimes the camera angles and lead to jumps in the wrong direction, making it difficult to complete some quests. All and all the game is great and now on the top of my list for favorite games (beating out the previous leader AC1). ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Even two years after the release of the first Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft Montreal remains undisputed in their mastery of traversing through and scaling buildings. More than any other game I can think of, Assassin's Creed II makes climbing ledge-riddled towers, shimmying across rooftops, and skipping from one wooden platform to the other truly feel like second nature. You're not mashing the A button to jump up to the next ledge; simply by holding down the trigger and holding the stick in a direction, your character smoothly transitions from one animation to the next, with few stutters or hard stops. It's both intuitive and genuinely satisfying.The fluidity of the platforming is compounded by the fact that the environments that you're crawling up are the cities of Florence, Tuscany, and Venice. Each ledge and roof fits into the world, and appears to serve a purpose other than to be scaled. You still get cases where certain bricks will stick out of walls in suspicious patterns, but they're in an extremely small minority.  These two things are the game's greatest asset; not only is the climbing and platforming near-flawless, but open in that your path to and from any mission is your own. However, there are a few key spots in the game (usually in enclosed areas), that force you onto one particular path, and this is altogether less fun. When you have to jump onto one specific platform and then another in order to proceed, the game becomes more like Prince of Persia than it should. It isn't that linearity is bad, but when you're used to choosing how you'll get somewhere, having to figure out the order you have to navigate what is essentially a three-dimensional maze is much less fun by comparison.    Of course, there's much more to the game than its Parkour aspects, and this is where it's able to make the most improvements over its predecessor. In this respect, Assassin's Creed II cleans up as much as it refines. The first Assassin's Creed tackled several concepts and executed about two-thirds of them well, and II cuts out what didn't work, improves what can work, and adds a host of elements that make the overall experience better.The most noticeable change is the structure of the game, or the lack thereof. You're no longer required to do a set number of side missions in order to advance the main story. Instead, the game encompasses everything that you'll need to know about your assassination targets in the story missions, where before side missions were your method of gathering information. Because of this, the game feels much more open and varied in nature. Since the side missions reward you with cash that can be used to upgrade armor, weapons, and a villa (a mini-game where you can invest in several parts of a stronghold to increase its value, which in turn gives you more money), you're more inclined to do them because they feel like a reward rather than a punishment (you can also choose to not do them and still end up okay). Because I wasn't forced to do them, it became easier to distract myself with them when I got tired of the main quest.The number of side missions is also much higher than in the first game, but it's more than a numbers game. The new side missions range from uncovering old tombs to full-on assassinations, with each type of mission having its own self-contained story. This, along with a number of collectibles, extend the length of the game for completists without bothering those who just want to enjoy the story quest.   Another much improved aspect is the dual-storyline approach that the original game took. The story of Desmond Miles and Abstergo takes a much farther back seat than it did the first time, which means less interludes and longer sessions in the Animus, where Desmond relives the memories of new protagonist Ezio Auiditore, who happens to be a much more interesting character than Altair.      Ezio's history is better defined and fleshed-out, his motivations are made clear early on, and his playboy wit is a nice contrast to Altair's cold, uncaring arrogance. You're learning your assassin skills at the same time he is, where before your character already knew everything he was capable of doing, and simply refused to do it until certain points in the game.     The flow of the story is also more interesting. It plays out like an odd combination of The Count of Monte Cristo and The Da Vinci Code. Since Ezio's story of revenge takes precedence to continuing the story from the first game, your main interaction with the world outside renaissance Italy is commentary from characters during your sessions in the Animus, as well as Glyphs that you can find in the world that reveal more about the conspiracy that resulted from the end of the first game. It's a bit detaching to learn about an alternate history of the world in between missions where you're piloting a flying machine into a palace, but it works well enough.     Combat, on the other hand, still manages to be the worst part of the game. It's better than it was in the first game, but it just doesn't match the rest of the game in terms of quality. The theme of diversity carries over into it, with a larger variety of weapons than before, both from Leonardo Da Vinci's workshop and from the ability to steal an enemy's weapon and use it against him, but fighting enemies is either too easy to be interesting or too hard to be worth it. Even with all your new toys, you'll find that you'll still end up resorting the same tactics you did before. You'll either stand still and wait to counter an enemy's attack to kill him instantly, or you mash the X button until you kill an enemy that takes more hits than any human could.   Fortunately, it's no longer your only option. If a group of guards is blocking your way, you can fight them, but it's much more fun (and effective) to hire a group of Courtesans to lure them away, or to hire a group of mercenaries to fight for you. The problem is that later missions have these options less frequently, which means that you'll forced to either sneak by guards unnoticed or face them.      Worse yet, there are a couple of missions that end instantly when you're detected, as well as missions where you have to fight bosses, who are essentially regular people with incredible amounts of health. It's frustrating, but aside from missions where you're forced into combat, you can get by most of the time by assassinating guards without being noticed.      A lack of variety is what made Assassin's Creed, an otherwise fantastic game, into a chore towards the end. Assassin's Creed II, however, addresses that problem, as well as most every other problem that the original had. It's far and away a better game in every respect. Unless you have a preference for the first game's setting, you really don't have much of a reason to play the first game anymore. And for those who didn't play (or like) the first one, you really don't have a reason to not play the second.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[First off let me start by saying this game is better than the first one by far.  If you enjoyed the first one but thought it was lacking in content then don't worry this game is much more enjoyable than the first and seems like much less of a chore to get to the meat of the game, the assassinations.  However, the game still has some significant shortcomings that I feel stop this game from being a 5 star game.    Improvements                 The best improvement of this game is without a doubt the combat, story, and the graphics.  The new setting makes for a much more colorful game and just a joy to be in, whereas the first one it felt very dark and an almost depressing area.  Here people are more alive and vibrant which just makes this city feel alive and just a joy to walk around in and see what people are doing.  The combat feels more intense and with so many different animations with all of the different kinds of weapons it makes fighting enemies just more fun.  It's more brutal and can almost make you wince every now and then, when you see a certain kill animation for the first time.  There are just so many options in combat that it makes every encounter fun and exciting from the first to last.  The story is greatly improved making you feel a connection towards Ezio compared to the first where you felt no real connection to Altair.  There are so many improvements but as you play you slowly start to see there are still many short comings to this game.    Needs Improvment  Probably my biggest complaint of the game is the movement, now don't get me wrong Ezio moves better than Altair, he's faster, more agile and makes moving about the city a blast, but there are many times that i felt the game wasn't doing what I wanted it to do.   Which given the amount of options that you are given when traveling the city, it's understandable, but still there are to many times where I felt that I didn't move the way i wanted to, and it did cause some frustration.  Even still the movement is still great you'll have a blast moving from rooftop to rooftop killing random archers.  Probably my only real complaint about the combat is the enemies, and this is that they don't explain how to fight some of the later enemies.  The bigger guys with long axes, swords, or spears can't be countered by any sword, dagger or hammer.  You need to have a spear, axe, or a long sword to do that which is obtained from the guards, so unless you where just carrying one on you at the time you need to disarm them or use your hidden blade.  This is fine but the game never explained that so I found out the hard way.  Also, while the story is improved and you feel a real justified reasoning to Ezio going from a care free life to becoming an assassin you still don't have a huge connection towards any of the characters.  They don't do a great job of keeping you updated of who the guy you are assassination is and why you should care.  Which makes you actions feel less important, and doesn't keep adding towards Ezio's hardship.  Basically, he is trying to justify what has happened to his family but that feels like that is it, and after so many hours of gameplay you don't quite care as much.  If they want this to be the primary reason of his actions then they need to keep fleshing that out because after a few hours in you slowly start to care less and less.   Expectations/Conclusion                 Which comes to why my title says I hope, you learn this early on in the game so this isn't a real spoiler, Desmond is living Ezio's life so he can learn his skills, ""years of training, learned in a few days"".  This leads to the idea of the next Assassin's Creed to take place in modern society which is an odd way to go, because of use of guns.  However they plan to go about the next one, whether they revisit ancient history or they are in modern times, I look forward to the next installment and have high hopes that they don't ruin the franchise if they do decide to go to modern times.                    This game is a lot of fun and is great to own, there are just some things I wished they added or fixed up.  The story is greatly improved but still lacks in the story telling, they just don't make you care as much, but they do raise many questions that will make you go out and get the next one as soon as possible.  The movement could definitly be better but is still a great part of the game and just feels better than the first.  I would have liked to seen a batman style side missions where you can just go into an arena and keep fighting enemies till your health reaches zero because the combat is just so good that I want just a place to keep fighting till I tire myself out.  All of that aside there are a ton of story missions that will keep you busy for a long time, side missions that are varied and a lot of fun, and a bunch of things to collect.  This game is a must play it just lacks major components to making it a 5 star game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed 2 Review  Ezio StabbyMcDoubleBladedJazzHands has just left the building.    The Good: Occasional moments of brilliance/awesome, free roaming, graphics  The Bad: Accuracy, the parts where you aren't killing someone, glitches   Oh, Desmond. You really drew the sort end of the Karma stick, didn't you? That must of been some horrible deal you pulled with the universe. ""Yeah, hey, you get to be a bartender for, say, ten or so years, and then we strap you into a giant chair, jam a visor over your face, and force you to relive one of your ancestors kill, oh, say, everyone. How's that sound? Deal? Sign on the dotted line! Oh, yeah, minor detail, but you'll be kidnapped for the length of your memory induced killing spree! But, boy, will you have a great dental plan!"" Will Desmond's lot in life improve in time for the seconds Assassin's Creed, or will our cuddly hoddie wearing bartender get an even shorter stick (Pssst: The forecast? Cloudy with a chance of very short stick.) Read on!  Review    Throughout most of Assassin's Creed II (Henceforth known as ""AC2"" or just ""AC"") you play as Ezio Auditore de Firenze, a young adult on Florence, whose daily chores involve washing the clothes, running along rooftops, playing with his sister, climbing buildings, getting places unseen, and taking out the trash. Your family gets the axe (Well, the noose. And it's only the males of your family. So, you know. Half your family gets the noose. Same thing) and you go on a roaring rampage of ravenous revenge.     Sort of.      See, the first assassination kills the guy who ganked your Dad and other male family members, and after that the game loses any sort of plot steam or momentum. Sure, the guys you're killing now maybe kinda sorta if you look at it the right way had something to do with killing half your family, but I *already* took care of the guy who back stabbed them. The game isn't helped out whatsoever in this matter by how the game times things. It takes you roughly twenty (yup, two-zero, 20, years) to finally get around to killing everyone who, if looked at after staring at the sun for several hours and making a funny half shut eyelid look, maybe had something to do with killing your folks. The smaller plot points that tie the larger plot points manage to do better, but only just. Sprinkle in a few plot twists here or there, maybe some questionable voice acting, and bingo bango bongo you've got a barely workable plot. If there's one saving grace of the entire story, it's that everybody's little death speech has been squeezed down to about 2-3 lines. Even this victory, however, is diluted since almost half of those 2-3 lines will be in Italian. No, really. About a quarter of the games dialog is in honest to goodness Italian. It's annoying.      But you aren't here to listen to Italian! You're here to stab people! To fly from rooftop to rooftop like the winged angel of wrist blades, bringing down your furious anger on those who have wronged you, those that might of wronged you, and poor guards who just want to feed their families and survive another day. These portions of the game work pretty much one to one with how they worked in Assassin's Creed 1. Sure, there are a few new moves. You can leap from the sky and stab people. You can shoot people with a concealed pistol. You can toss money (Money money money!) into the street to distract people. You can reach over a ledge and yank someone to their doom. You can kill someone and hide them in cover. You can leap from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease, the wonderful man on the swinging trapeze. However, the basics of the game still remain. Do a bunch of missions you really wish you weren't doing. Sneak through the city with guards on super high vigilant if-you-litter-I-will-turn-your-body-into-an-arrow-pincushion mode, stab someone in the back (Or the face! The game is an equal opportunity stabber), and then flee.    The problems remain the same as they were in Assassins' Creed 1 as well, just...expanded. Sure, there are more diverse missions with 100% less flags to find (Damn flags), but by the end of the game you'll be just as sick of beating people up, stabbing random people, and racing others as you were of eavesdropping and pickpocketing as you were in the first AC. Sure, you'll enjoy the numerous new weapons, enemy types, and counter moves until you realize that all you have to do is one of two different two button press moves to kill pretty much every enemy in the game. If there's one major difference between AC1 and AC2, it's that now there are lots of plot specific missions to hate, instead of just merely three generic missions to hate. You'll guide thieves to their rooftop hiding spots. You'll escort mercs to their ground based mischief places. You'll escort lots of people around town as they talk your ear off. You'll kill guards. You won't kill guards. You'll run on rooftops. You won't run on rooftops. The common denominator in all of these is that you'll be staring at your TV, bored out of your mind, wondering why the hell you aren't doing awesome assassinations.     Eventually, you'll get to these assassinations and it is then, and only then, that the game manages to pick up all of it's subpar pieces and provide you with an experience that is possibly worth the price of entry. You'll sneak through a party and time shooting a baddie with your hidden gun to coincide with the ongoing fireworks show. You'll scale the walls of a fortress before dropping into an open window to cause your mischief. You'll fly (yes, fly) on one of Leonardo's drawings brought brilliantly to life by the (virtual) man himself. You'll bound from rooftop to rooftop as you chase down two fleeing targets in a crowded dock area filled with sailors and guards.      And fly you will. The free running system from AC1 is back with a vengeance, and with, you guessed it, the same problems as the first! The game is great at broad brushstrokes of movement, and if you don't care how you get from point uno to point dos, the free running system works like a charm. The moment you attempt to do anything accurate, however, the game breaks down in quite a bad way. This was bad in the first Assassin's Creed, but in AC2 it's even worse due to the increased emphasis on accuracy and the generally larger move set. The number of awesome assassination moments was quickly outpaced by the number of curse laden tirades I subject my TV set to. ""No!"" I may scream at the lifeless color dots staring back at me ""I wanted you to jump from fucking pole to fucking pole, not slam your head into a bridge! Why the goddamn hell would you think I'd want to do that!"" Another one of my favorites was when, hanging off a ledge, I wanted to assassinate a guard. I hit my assassination button and fully expected Ezio to reach up, grab the guy, and send him to his doom. Instead, Enzo jumps up, stands in full view of the guard...and merely flicks his hidden blades in an out. I couldn't help but literally face palm myself as the guard promptly hit me, sending me flying off of my rooftop perch and to the cold, hard, and deadly ground below.     I could continue to go on about smaller things. The sound's wonderful. The new money system/villa is somewhat headscratching but not a gamebreaker. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, easily some of the best this generation. Your characters hands will clip numerous times through the object you want to grab, only for Ezio to totally miss them and grab something else entirely (Or, worse, not grab anything at all and return to your starting position.) The camera guy deserves a handshake and a bullet to the head for his performance in the open world (the handshake) and timed sections (The bullet.) Bodies do a funny glitch whenever they die, which turns not so funny when they glitch themselves off of a rooftop and alert some guards. However, none of this matters. Your enjoyment of Assassin's Creed 2 will be measured based off of how much soul crushingly annoying slash bad slash aggravating parts you can withstand in order to get to the genuinely rockawesome assassinations.   Conclusions    For me, the payoff was not worth the price of admission. No matter how awesome the next assassination promised to be (and yes, practically every assassination lived up to that promise), chugging through the low parts tying the pure distilled win (the assassinations) together eventually became too much for me. However, if you can survive the horribad parts, Assassin's Creed 2 might just be worth it. Three Point Five out of Five.  Authors note: This was crossposted at the Escapist User Review forums. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[this game was pure awesome, the main campaign was swell, and the collectables were awesome. just trying to unlock that 1000G was a challenge in itself! cant wait for the sequal!  also the easter eggs in the game were pretty cool too.   BASTARDO!!]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed II Review  Two years ago it seemed a lot of people had to lob some justification in front of their enjoyment out of Assassin's Creed, or harsh criticism for their contempt with the game. Neither side was necessarily wrong. The game laid out a heady story,  catapulted parkour as a genre mainstay, and blended elements of action and stealth to appease plenty of fans. It was also terribly bogged down by poor pacing, repetitive side missions and utterly inept AI to contend with, so you can understand peoples love or hate relationship with the beginning iteration into the planned franchise.  If Ubisoft has done one thing with Assassin's Creed 2, and I'll argue they've done more, it's their ability to show they aren't precious or stubborn, that they'll listen to peoples qualms and address them in a meaningful way. As a result, we're left with a far better game that helps drive the series forward by making headway with almost every single issue that cropped up the first go around. For the uninitiated, you play as Desmond, a modern-day everyman from a bloodline of assassins. A war has been going on between Templars and Assassin's for a centuries, and you're the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding it all. You do this by laying down on an Animus, a system by which Desmond can jack into memories of his ancestors - think Matrix and you're in the right ballpark. But this is all just the setup to get you where you really want to be, before it was with Altair in the middle east, but this go around you play as Ezio in Italy circa late 14oo's. This is the first mark of improvement in the series, as the towns of Florence and Venice and subsequent surrounding areas are far more vibrant and diverse. It adds a spark that's subtle and reigns you into a world that feels far more believable and real.  In one of the outer areas if the game you'll encounter your home, a villa at the top of a small rundown and terribly drab village. You're given the options to invest in the town, by renovating shops, or rebuilding thieves guilds or brothels. While the only real reward is a high value given to your villa, which helps raise funds for you to collect and use, you'll also notice that the town becomes a little more active. Open up the church and the brothel and you'll see beautiful women and monks passing by in town that weren't there before. You'll get better gear and bigger discounts at shops. You can adorn your villa with wonderful works of art. It's these touches that breath some life into the world and help with the immersion. If I had any complaints, it's the I wish it was even more interactive, perhaps some side missions tied into your town or NPC's to interact with. Given the scale of the game it becomes a minor issue that doesn't hamper the game but if they utilize a similar town or home base in the third game I hope it's something they take into consideration. Scale here is important to note. While the first game was large, and that was hammered in by the fact that you had to hop on a horse to get anywhere (a most cumbersome affair), AS2 feels bigger, and has more to do. There isn't a ton of secondary missions, still more than the first time, but at least they're more fun. You can race, perform assassination contracts, deliveries or beat-em-ups. They're sort of there, but only at your choosing -- they also aren't really tied into achievements or trophies beyond doing a single one...something I actually appreciated -- and while you can do them all if you want, they aren't needed to extend the game to feel like you're getting your monies worth. At the completion of the game, having collected all 100 Feathers as well I had reached just under 26 hours of gameplay. I completed only 1 of each side mission and all Tomb Missions, the rest was all story. It's a treat now days to get a game that offers a lengthy campaign without feeling strung along, and you never do here. The combat mechanics are seemingly untouched from the first game, which isn't entirely bad. The combat worked the first time, even though it was fairly simplified and grew repetitive. AS2 adds a couple nice additions by way of new weapons and gadgets, which help broaden the depth, if only just enough to feel fresh. A second assassin's blade makes for a deadly weapon while sneaking and a formidable match against guards using axes, swords, or spears, each of which you can pickup or purchase yourself. Smoke bombs and throwing money add to distraction options to help get away from guards, and throwing stars are still around to pick off archers. It's really the new weapons that provide the most enjoyment, as some clearly work better in some situations than others. It's here though that the AI show's some kinks. At times I was able to walk up to 4 guards and assassinate them all without a single one drawing a weapon on me. Stealth elements also highlight just how dense they can seem when you plop right behind them a loot treasure or walk away after stabbing someone right behind their back. These issue's don't hamper anything for too long, and players that played the first to death will notice some improved enemy attack patterns.  A huge reason why everything comes together so much better this time around is because the story and the protagonist are far more enjoyable. While the AS1 painted an intriguing world, it was a choppy affair that ended rather predictably seen through the eyes of a rather passive and unlikable character. Altair followed orders blindly without much sense of self motivation or involvement beyond being the murderer sent around. Ezio on the other hand is thrust into this situation after the brutal murder of his father and brothers, he too was to be hung but escapes in time to plot his revenge. While it's more bloodthirsty, it's still very easy to relate to his pain and choices and makes for a much smoother narrative. The story takes a couple leaps into the full-blown mythic sci-fi realm towards the end of the game, but I can honestly say that everything moves the story forward in such a way that's sure to make people want to come back for the third game. There's a refined hand in the way this is all laid out, instead of jumping back and forth from Desmond to Ezio, you only come back into the modern day setting a few times, which means there's no going to bed and sitting back down for every memory sync. It moves everything along and keeps you doing whatever you want, and it forces the story to unfold while playing instead of in some clunky exposition filled discussion with characters that don't seem part of the story you're actually focused on. One last note on added little touches. The gadgets that you unlock as you progress are given to you by none other than Leonardo Da Vinci, who isn't just a throwaway character so people feel smart for knowing a name, but he's actually a friend of Ezio's that helps him out and requires a hand or two himself. It adds some credence to stuff you use, and fleshes out this world to help it straddle the line between reality and game. A little history never hurt anyone, after all. Assassin's Creed II makes every intention to be better than it's predecessor, and it does so proudly and without negotiating away it's stellar setup. While the issues were never in the sound or graphics of the first game, they've still maintained a beautiful world full of life to explore while stepping up every other aspect in both subtle and obvious ways. A minute number of problems remain for the ultra-nitpicky, but none of them hold this back form being a triple-A title. If this is proof of what a developer can do with a little criticism and a sequel - my only wish is that we could get more than just a 3rd game out of the franchise.  The World: Italy not only makes for beautiful scenery, but it offers a more varied and fresh world than anything in AS1. The towns themselves feel different and large, giving you every reason to want to spend a little more time climbing every building just to catch the view. 10/10 The Combat: It's the weapons that sell it this time around, but it's still a fluid system that's intuitive enough to grasp for most, and just deep enough to offer some complexity and options. The AI could be improved to provide some more challenge, however, as you'll still realize that one solid strategy will get you through three quarters of the game safely. 8/10 The Story: Being a sequel, it'll be hard for anyone that didn't play the first to keep pace during this game with a lot of the stuff that's going on. But it's also a more focused and simple story at it's core, outside of the over-arching trilogy that it's all fueling. With a likable protagonist to relate to this time around it's far more fun to play the role of the assassin. 9/10 The Sound and Visual: Some of the best moments come while atop a building, staring out over the landscape and the town around you. The draw distance is astonishing, and the details to the city layout or more than just admirable. Some of the cutscenes, however, are showing their age for the engine. The dialogue here is better, and the voices seem to be spread a bit more thick as well - still the rumblings of the town will start to sound all the same after ten hours of running around. 8/10 The Improvements: Maybe we should just expect this every time we play a sequel, but if you play enough games you know that it just isn't always the case. Ubisoft went out and addressed everything that made people shy away from the first As or kept it from being truly remarkable. You can swim, you feel more apart of the town, you feel like you have a real impact on the world, you don't need to sit on benches to listen to people, you don't need to do side-quests but there's more of them, there's more weapons, more ways to assassinate, more ways to infiltrate, you can boat around on a  gondola, your armor damages, and your acrobatics feel better than ever culminating in some of the best platforming side missions I've ever seen- they make you wonder what Prince of Persia coulda have been if it starred Ezio. I applaud the approach to developing when it's not taken so defensively, when producers realize they can always do something better and so long as they try -- we'll all see the fruits of their labor. 10/10 SCORE: 90% ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2 is of course the sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. It mainly plays the same as the first game but it is just so much more than the first game. The sequel will take you roughly 12-15 hours to complete just the main story and to be frank its kind of easy, but the story will really just blow you away. I also like how Ezio is more social and kind of fits into the time period more than Altair does because that was a minor problem in the first game. I also liked how you could use different factions to help you accomplish your goals and that they varied the mission types a lot in this game. The only flaws in this game is that there are some glitches, Ezio's movements can get a bit out of hand, and the assassinations are kind of less dramatic and important than the first game but those are only minor complaints on an otherwise fantastic experience.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[   Assassin’s Creed 1 starred a preachy, philosophical, emotionless, characterless unibomber-lookalike named Altair. Killing was his business, but business was not good. First he had to pickpocket, eavesdrop and stalk random targets to obtain “information”, or rather grind missions to extend play, time about his victims-to-be. He would then proceed to attempt an assassination on said targets, one that would involve stealth and cunning…on paper. In practice, they usually ended in extended fight sequences, combating both a tiresome barrage of respawning enemies and cumbersome climbing mechanics and a dull combat system. When you finally killed your last target and a grand unveiling of the true nature of the game’s sacred artifact was about to occur, the “flashback” was cut off. Players were brought back to the present day storyline, of Altair’s descendant, Desmond, being held captive by templars and…the game ended with him continuing to be trapped. Many questions were thrust on the player, and the only surefire answer provided was “buy our sequel two years from now.”     And now we have Assassin’s Creed 2 to address some of those annoying cliffhanger questions…while providing plenty more mysteries anger players with the notion of waiting another two years. But while the first game was a wholly aggravating experience from beginning to end, Assassin’s Creed 2 only has slight growing pains and issues with modern times. Rather, unlike ex-girlfriends and boyfriends everywhere, Assassin’s Creed 2 thrives when it lives in the past.      Ezio stabs a foe in the urinary tract. The game begins with Desmond being liberated from his prison by that blonde chick, whom switches from cliché empathetic scientist girl to cliché ass-kicking woman in leather. After the breakout, Desmond finds solace in the assassin’s headquarters…or rather, the apartment of some preppy British geek and his stoned best friend science girl who moonlights as the the girl on change room duty at Urban Behavior. They have an Animus of their own, and they’re going to use it to Matrix-ise Desmond into an assassin. Honestly, everything about the “present day” plot sucks, and I mean everything. It’s hard to accept the struggle between assassins and templars as some kind of history-shaping struggle when the assassins look like Chess Club members and the templars like mall cops with batons. The almighty templars with infinite resources can’t afford guns. Despite centuries of history, neither party would survive a night in .    Bear with me when I say that the game as a whole is more interesting when dealing with the past storyline. And I really do mean “bear with me” because even that aspect takes awhile to build steam. You alternately spend most of the game as Ezio, a noble paysan in 1400s . He’s young, brash, charming, and you’ll have to go through a series of tutorial missions to get these points across. The tutorial is long. Lengthy. Unending. Verbose. Extensive. Substantial. Hulking. Massive. Voluminous. Elongated. Mammoth. As fun as watching  play soccer. And any other word for long and drab your thesaurus may boast. The Grand Theft Auto 4 tutorial cowers in comparison, feeling ashamed that it cannot ever aspire to be as extended and boring as the Assassin’s Creed 2 tutorial. You have to undergo tutorials on how to jump, climb, fistfight, swordfight, bribe prostitutes, pickpocket your money back from them, taunt, flail your arms, and explain the many different forms of side-quests. It took me about a week of casual play (about 1-2 hours a day) before I got to partake in my first assassination. You can understand why I empathize the importance of bearing with me when I say that this game does eventually become great.       Somewhere within that lengthy tutorial process of making Ezio pay his dues, his father and brothers are unjustly killed and thus begins his descent from cheery nobleman to ruthless-but-still-cheery assassin. The  storyline then bases itself around Ezio’s quest to dispatch the conspirators responsible, all of whom just happen to be templars.       Hypothetically, if I cut the guy's head off. Would he still monologue after his death? And the revenge quest part of Assassin’s Creed 2 is really where the game shines. Ezio is an appealing character that never falls in the same religious/ideological preaching sessions that Altair spent too much time being pre-programmed into mechanically spouting. You’ll witness his development over a ten year span, including positive and negative thoughts, and he’s surrounded by a bustling Italian landscape filled with poor people, prostitutes, that jolly next door neighbour Leonardo Da Vinci and his own little code… more poor people and plenty of lively characters and lavish buildings to climb. It’s hard to not get enraptured by the game’s scenery. That this is the only game with this unique European setting gives Assassin’s Creed 2 a wonderfully unique sense of style and immersion.    Just be sure to play the game with subtitles turned on. The characters have a tendency to slip between English and Italian as often as Italian grandparents. Even though most of the Italian spoken word consisted of prayer and swearing, sometimes in combination, it’s still nice to have the translation.     Oh, and there are religious themes. This game was made by that very same multi-cultural team of various religious beliefs, after all. Keep that in mind during the…final sequence.     Assassin’s Creed 2 is a sandbox game, though a sandbox game where you cannot kill civilians without punishment. (For you see, Ezio never harmed a civilian in his entire life, which I have a hard time believing.) You run around, you climb structures with the same Prince of Persia/Assassin’s Creed 1/Tomb Raider/Imfamous/Uncharted/Uncharted 2 climbing system that’s starting to get a bit tired in games. Most of the climbing is automated, but Ezio’s pathfinding can be a bit suspect at times. He has the occasional habit of jumping off his ledge and in the wrong direction, sometimes to his untimely dea…I mean desynchronization. This is especially profanity-inducing during certain timed platform sequences. And the sword combat isn’t particularly exciting. It still comprises mainly of timing button presses to execute combos and counters, and while there are a few new moves (mainly the ability to jack another fool’s weapon) you’ll most likely employ a mindset of “attack a lot, then block when attacked” in combat. It’s not a bad combat system, just one that lacks the flow of Batman: Arkham Asylum, and to be fair, Jackie Chan and Jet Lee as martial artists don’t quite have the flow of Batman: Arkham Asylum either.    I hope at this point you’ve bore with me up to now, because even though the platforming seems drab and the combat average, the rest of the game is quite entertaining. Those annoying pickpocket/eavesdrop/stalking missions have vanished altogether. The next story mission is almost always at accessible immediately, only asking the player to grind a fetch quest near the game’s end. (There are codex pages scattered around the world that you can collect on your own throughout your journey, and getting them is a simple matter of distracting the guards with hired floozies. So this fetch quest as a whole is harmless.) Most of the story missions are varied and enjoyable, offering a much higher ratio of time spent killing to time spent not killing than in the prior game. You’ll kill plenty of guards, often by sneaking up to them and hidden-blading their asses, and the variety of challenges that await you ensure that the campaign never grows tiresome.      I hate you, Desmond. I hate you and don't want to play as you in Assassin's Creed 3. Now, not all of the missions are great. The game doesn’t quite approach the same ratio of great levels to wastes of time that Grand Theft Auto 4 achieves. In particular, Assassin’s Creed 2 may feature the lamest rendition of Capture The Flag in the history of video games, and that may actually be a rare achievement. But the post-tutorial game moves at a consistently brisk pace, assuming that you even want to play the story missions. The optional side missions, including assorted assassinations, muggings, races and so forth are exciting enough to occupy your attention. In particular, there are six set-piece “tomb” levels that will have you traverse a specific platforming sequence, giving chase or solving weird timed puzzle sequences. This isn’t like other games that rehash side missions to artificially pad out the game’s length. It just happens that you’ll feel more inclined to take time away from the main plot to indulge yourself, and time will just magically fly by. The money earned can be spent on assorted upgrades (and you’re always going to need the best sword available if you want to have fun with the combat) or renovating your home villa, for Ezio is the Mike Holmes of assassins. Renovating your village is intended to be an investment; money made from tourism goes into a chest that you subsequently and unethically pocket yourself, the corrupt politician you are. The issue with this whole system is that “quick-travel” stations are scarcely scattered around the map, hence you’ll waste an unnecessary amount of time just to collect your paycheck.    Back on the positive side, the game gives you a greater sense of control. New abilities like the pistol upgrade give you more options for dispatching your fellow goomba. The addition of two hidden blades lets you feel more like Steven Segal in allowing you to end the lives of two soldiers simultaneously, and from different positions. Whether it’s killing from ledges or while hidden in a haystack, the game puts a greater emphasis on stealth kills. The guard AI is kind of dimwitted in a variety of ways, most notably how they’ll never notice how one of their fellow workers has suddenly vanished, but their ignorance provided me with great bliss as I picked them off one-by-one. And should you decide to run from the large flock of guards giving chase, new options like the ability to hide in any crowd and not just four strategically placed scholars give you a greater sense of control. Gone are the days where you ran around blind, hoping the guards would suddenly lose sight and you just happen to notice a pile of hay to slip into.       So Assassin’s Creed 2 is a great game…all the way to the end. As I and most anyone else predicted, the game ends with another cheap cliffhanger, opening up tons of questions and completely reworking the plot in the name of building towards an Assassin’s Creed 3. Without elaborating too much, the “plot change” is cheesy as all hell, and almost puts a damper on the Ezio revenge quest that I fell so in love with. But the damage done at the end doesn’t quite sour the experience the way the first game’s ending did; rather, it merely kills off whatever enthusiasm I could’ve held for Assassin’s Creed 3, knowing the direction the story will follow now.     But let us live for the moment instead. Standing on its merits as both an action game and an immersive experience, Assassin’s Creed 2 is a treat. It isn’t perfect but is perfection something that exists anyways? The redeeming qualities are worth experiencing for yourself in spite of the flaws. Just remember that if this is your first experience with the franchise, to not give in to curiosity and play Assassin’s Creed 1. You’re not missing much.     4 stars    Actually, there is a few flaws in the game I should mention, but it’s more an issue with me than the game itself. The characters in the game revere Altair as some kind of legendary prophet or hero. I disagree with them. I did not want to see anything from the first game revered as sacred.    Also, I have beef with any game that feels it should have an achievement system separate from the Xbox one. Now Ubi Soft has to have its own online achievement system. Why? ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Do you remember Assassin's Creed? If you do, you are likely to remember the god-awful lack of variety that game had. Still, a few of us also remember a bit more than that. The sun-drenched cities of Jerusalem, Acre and Damaskus, the feeling when you leaped of  a building the first time, the sensational thrill the first time you stabbed a guy in the throat with your hidden blade...The list goes on, but you get the picture. It was fun the first time you did it, but after a while it just got tedious and boring.   It's a relief, then, that the second game does not follow the same path as the first. This time around you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian nobleman that after a tragic incident with his family is forced to become an assassin. The fact that you're not an assassin from the beginning is so much more logical than the first game's ""I'm a super-assassin but I got degraded so now I can't do shit""-situation. It also enables the player to get more attached to Ezio than you ever could with Altair, as you follow his struggle for personal revenge over the first 40 years of his life as opposed to  watching Altair kill some dudes every now and again. Also, since the story this time around is much crazier than the first game's story, you are more compelled to finish the game now than you ever were before.  The story isn't the only thing that's changed in Assassin's Creed 2. In fact, almost everything has changed. The mission types, the weapons, the combat system, even some aspects of the climbing system, have all changed. Even though the combat system is mostly the same, the introduction of counter kills with your fists and hidden blades as well as the ability to disarm your opponent makes all the difference in the world. It all feels smoother now, and as you no longer have to rely only on your sword when fighting guards the combat's actually fun this time around.  The biggest change in Assassin's Creed 2, however, is the missions. In the first game, you knew already after 10 minutes of playing what that game was about. Nothing changed over the course of the game, you did the same things over and over again and you knew what was going to happen. In the second installment, you never know what's going to happen. And I mean never. Ever. One minute you're climbing a tower to stab a guy in the throat,  the next you're kicking a guy in the chest while flying Leonardo Da Vinci's flying machine. Although assassinating targets may become a bit tedious over time, the incorporation of non-assassinating elements in the game creates a feeling that the game always has something new to offer and that feeling helps keeping your interest in the game alive.   Not everything is great about the game, though. In some cases, I found the facial animations of some characters to be disturbingly bad. We're talking pre-Xbox 360 bad here, people. It really is a shame, as the cities and environments in the game are so beautifully done. It's almost so bad that you tend to wanna skip the film sequences, which of course is far from a good thing. And, also, there are some minor controlling issues. Sometimes when you're climbing a building, the camera angles tend to fuck up in weird ways and make Ezio jump totally in the wrong direction. This is extremely annoying when you've spent a few minutes scailing a tower and almost reached the top, only to find Ezio sky diving into a body of hay.  But really, that's just making mountains of mole hills.  So please, by all means, buy this game as it is not something you want to miss out on. It's lenghty and jam-packed with  stealth murdering, free-roaming and steering caravans, all in a beautifully made Reneissance Italy presented in HD-graphics. Really, you can't go wrong with that.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ A lot of people had issues with the first game, though I liked it quite a lot. Still, it had its flaws. Running around, climbing up buildings, and sticking dudes with your hidden blade was a lot of fun. But the amount of variety in the missions was extremely limited - none of the tasks were by themselves terribly boring, but when there's only a handful that repeat constantly, it can become a drag. This is where the sequel sees its biggest improvement - the main progression through the game is much more involved and story-based, with the more mundane tasks set aside as option side missions. The limit to what you can do hasn't expanded greatly - you're still stealthily taking out Templars, visiting various hard to reach locations, trailing people and eavesdropping to gather information. Some annoyances are still there, like the beggars being replaced with minstrels. You're just more invested in what you're doing because you believe in Ezio's personal cause more than you did in Altair's sense of duty.And there are improvements to be seen everywhere. Your arsenal of weapons and acrobatic moves is expanded. There's more visual variety as missions can take place at different times of the day and events like festivals can change the atmosphere. There's a whole economy added now to buy items and improved equipment, although it's a little broken. The reward for almost everything you do is money, though once you've fully upgraded your home you basically never run out of it, limiting how useful more of it becomes. I didn't notice a big difference in the quality of the weapons, even between the best and the worst, and regardless of how much health/armor you have it didn't seem to have a big influence on how long you can stay alive. But you can pay for transit quickly between distant places, and there's a bunch of optional content that's some of the most interesting I've seen in a game. Tracking down seals in hidden tombs is an actual test of your platforming skill that eventually rewards you with some nice gear, and finding hidden glyphs on buildings throughout Italy unlocks interesting little puzzles that expand on the game's ridiculous yet entertaining story.Not everything's better though. People complained about the first game constantly kicking you back into the real world where the series' true protagonist Desmond is being experimented on, but I thought it was an intriguing element to the story and enjoyed the drip-feed of new information, while there's only a couple of those sort of segments in this game. They're fairly revealing, but it made it easier to forget what the game's really about. The aforementioned glyphs helped, but I still missed it. And I thought the first game's setting was more interesting than Renaissance Italy. The game does interesting stuff with art and history there, but I enjoyed the aesthetic less, and things like Venice's canals made it harder to get around. Also, one thing that's not much improved is the combat. The new variety of weapons is cool, but it's still a lot of waiting for the opportunity to counter your enemy's attacks, with some of the complexity and danger actually taken out - you never have to worry about getting grabbed, and it seems overall a lot easier to bolt and avoid danger altogether. And the facial animation actually seems way worse - especially on Kristen Bell's character. The game's environments look nice, but not so much the conversations.The story is worth mentioning, mostly because it's totally insane. You get a taste of the vast, millennia-long secret war between Assassins and Templars in the first game, but the sequel really dives into the crazy conspiracy aspect of it, and it's almost too over-the-top. As you can tell from the hidden messages in the glyphs, there's hardly a significant event in the last two thousand years of history that these groups and the ""pieces of Eden"" they found haven't had a hand in, and the number of famous people involved is astounding. I totally enjoyed this aspect of the plot - if you're gonna imply something this big, go ahead and go crazy with it. It's all dwarfed by the ending though, which reveals more about the conflict's origins than anyone could possibly comprehend. It's - it's just nuts. And it's all wrapped in Ezio's story, which is pretty solid on its own in places. If I was looking forward to what happened next after the first game, I'm positively foaming over it now. Creed II is one of the most fun open-world games I've ever played, and I'm extremely curious when and where the next one will take place. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[            Assassin's Creed II is a step in the right direction as most of the issues which had dragged the first experience down have been ironed out leaving a much more enjoyable experience.      If anything is a theme with this year's AAA titles is that most are sequels and it’s Ubisoft’s next attempt with Desmond's story in Assassin's Creed II. Many changes that have been made in this next instalment focus on correcting the issues with the first such as the repetitive structure, but some clever improvements have been made to the character progression that this time round Assassin's Creed 2 is a thrill to play from start to finish.   If you aren't familiar with the Assassin's story so far then it may be difficult to comprehend what is going on in AC2. You are treated to a series of flashing images and a brief explanation of the war going on between the Assassin's and the Templar’s that has carried on throughout history. You start as Desmond Miles, the test subject that was put in the Animus machine in the first game, making you remember the memories of the assassin Altair. Desmond is in a similar situation but this time he is looking at the memories of the new assassin, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. However the story inside the Animus plays out slightly differently, as instead of being part of the Assassin's Creed you are just a no good rebellious young man. You soon get involved into some shady business and before you know it your father is murdered by a corrupt official. This sparks Ezio's path to become an Assassin following in his father’s footsteps and to take revenge on his father’s murder. The story then moves through many twists and turns and you soon find out that the templar’s are plotting to unearth an ancient secret and that your father's murder is part of a much bigger plan. You will encounter a few familiar characters from the first game outside the Animus but inside you will be joined by a selection of different characters, one of which being Leonardo Da Vinci who will be with you the entire story as a crafts man to build all the assassin's weapons and also a flying machine, which you only get to use once.   Of course the story of the first Assassin's game wasn't bad at all but the way in which it was presented and played out was the issue. The repetitive mission structure is now almost banished, I say almost because it depends on how many side missions you do. These side missions can range from beating up a wife’s cheating husband, to racing thieves across rooftops and your standard assassination contracts. For myself I purposely missed these off, only doing each one once to get an idea of what was install for me, but after doing one of each I could see that if you planned to do every side mission you came across then this could become tedious and go back to the old repetitive structure. Instead I chose to focus on only story missions, finding viewpoints and some minor collecting of feathers which act as the flags out of the first game. You shouldn't be worried either about completing this game too quickly either as doing the structure of playing I described above lasted me over 20 hours.   If the only thing that put you off the first AC was the repetitive structure then you should be already satisfied with AC2 as the core gameplay of the game remains the same. Climbing and free running remain one of the main focuses of the game and is still as easy to pull off. The combat is still a waiting game, timing your attacks to counter the enemies and to then see an awesome kill animation. However, the amount of weapons and moves you can pull off has been increased. Throwing sand in the enemies’ eyes, shoving two hidden blades into the enemies back, disarming an enemy and using his spear to trip him up only to slam his spear in his face, the list goes on. The different ways of taking down enemies is much broader, but that does not mean that all are as useful. I found in particular the poison hidden blade and the gun to be the most unloved out of all the arsenal, as the bog standard double hidden blades where my weapon of choice as the speed of attacks and the disgusting yet glorious kill animations that where achieved by using these meant they were hard to put away. There was nothing better than when Ezio quickly stabbed a fool in the chest ten plus times in quick succession.   Combat aside the other aspects of AC2 like the armour upgrades and the small hint of an economy system makes it feel a much fuller experience. Granted the economy system is just upgrading buildings to a third tire, which can be done on your third or fourth visit back to the town, are just nice features to see. The character load out is more flexible allowing you to swap armour and weapons for what you like, but it isn't as in-depth as any RPG out there, as you will already know what the best armour is after two hours of playing so I held off for that, occasionally buying some new armour along the way. The money side of the game again isn't as in-depth as I would have like as potions to heal yourself are as cheap as chips, and the only other use I found with the money is to throw it on the floor to create a distraction to slip passed some guards, as I never found myself short of change.   The locations you will visit during your assassinations will vary in look ranging from the sandy city of Florence, to the grassy hills of Tuscany and of course the romantic city of Venice. Each city looks great and you can really get a sense of scale when looking out from the tallest viewpoint. All feel very different too as the guard’s change their attire but also the street chatter varies. However, most of the background dialogue you will hear is repeated and can start to become just annoying, especially when chasing a messenger only having him screaming, 'Please don't kill me!' every two seconds in the same tone.   The most exciting times in Assassin's Creed II are of course the assassinations themselves. However sometimes, actually most of the time you are spotted before you can perform a stealthy assassination causing the whole sequence to become a chase scene. This took something away from it, but it made it all the sweeter when you succeeded the stealthy way. After each assassination you still have the small dialogue sequence and then the chase after. This quickly became my second favourite part of game, first place going to stabbing two fools in the face, as the amount of ways to escape your enemies keeps you thinking on your feet. Throwing a smoke bomb on the floor or sand in their eyes are very useful, or maybe you would prefer a full on fight or a chase onto the rooftops. Each way was as fun as the other and in the introduction of Venice means that jumping in water and swimming away is always an option.   After I put down the controller and finished the story I didn't feel disappointed, as some people may. The story definitely leaves it wide open and gives a slight conclusion but followed by a, what next. The entire experience of Assassin's Creed II is sadly what the first should have been, however Ubisoft have not only just improved on the faults of the first but built on the framework adding meat and substance to the game. All the characters feel more believable and the main protagonist is much more likable. To sum up this game is everything the first should have been and more, if you were a fan of the first you won't be let down and if you want to brush up on your Italian Renaissance history this is for you. I mean come on you can stab two dudes in the face.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[               Assassin’s Creed II is a truly incredible game.   The gameplay is one of the most fluid, and fantastic experiences in any game.   The dialogue is hilarious as well as just great dialogue because it has such an amazing story to tell, which is tells perfectly.   Oh, and then there’s the story, o man… where to start…. I’ll just tell you that it’s awesome for now. Gameplay.   There are a few different sections to look into when you’re looking at the gameplay.   The combat, economy system, collectibles, mission variety (that’s right I said variety unlike the fist game), the replay value, as well as the in game tombs to explore, and the extremely large world. Combat: The combat is simply amazing, it keeps the winning formula from the first game: counters.   There might not be as many counter animations as you want in the game, but there are still a lot.   Also, instead of the game being all like, you’re Altair, you get his sword and his sword only, there are 22 weapons to buy and you can disarm enemies and keep that weapon until you decide to start sprinting.   The combat is extremely bloody and satisfying, but the hidden blade still wins over anything else.   Oh, speaking of hidden weapons! You now have a double hidden blade, hidden poison syringe, and a hidden gun, and YES all of them are as awesome as they sound. The economy system:   No one asked for an economy system, so Ubisoft decided to take the risk and do it anyways, and let me tell you that I was quite nervous for this.   But oh man, did they ace it.   You can buy paintings to improve the value of your villa in Tuscany, which you get income for every 20 minutes or something, improving the value means you get more money.   You can buy different colored robes which add the finishing touch to you’re dear little Ezio, and you can buy poison and medicine from doctors.   But then there are the blacksmith, and o god are they disappointing.   There are a total of 22 weapons which are pretty good, but then you look to get a long weapon and you cannot buy them, but the guards have them and you can disarm them, however you cannot keep them, which greatly disappointed me. (-.1) Collectables: wow, another thing that Ubisoft decided to throw into the mix of additions to the sequel, that they nearly aced.   There are 6 seals that you have the option to collect by exploring tombs, which are extremely fun to play.   Ubisoft aced this because the tombs are not only extremely fun, but have a reward when you collect all 6 seals at the end of each tomb.   This reward is awesome because it is one of the strongest armors in the game; Altair’s armor.   Another thing are the feathers, which I found to be just annoying as the flags from the game’s predecessor except there are one hundred total in the entire world.   The last are the glyphs, glitches in the animus left by the previous subject to show you ‘the truth’ I’m still working on that though. Mission Variety and Replay Value: Even though Ubisoft added a whole new array of spices to their new game, they still took constructive criticism from the last game.   I played through the entire story mode and the only bit of it that was repetitive was the oh look new target, kill him; however, how and where you kill him are all different, you have different allies almost every time, and there are different settings in which you assassinate someone, keeping a huge variety.   Just like the first game, the main reason you would want to replay this game is because you want to get the collectables; however, I thought the story was so incredible that I’m going to replay it just for that. Large Worlds: Ubisoft yet again impressed everyone by making such a large open world, just like the did in the first game.   However, this game completely owns the first game when it comes to the world size.   I beat the game and have not been to everywhere in each city; but I will tell you that all the cities are extremely fun and very big, they include: Florence, 2 towns in Tuscany (unless there are more that I haven’t found but I doubt it), Venice, Romagna, and Rome.   But Rome was extremely disappointing because the only place you can go is the Vatican, I want to yell at the person who decided this because the two main reasons I was excited for Rome was the Vatican and The Colosseum, oh yeah then there’s the capital and all the OTHER awesome buildings that they did not include, (-.1).   However, since all the other cities are so huge they make up for this disappointment.   I have heard that the 3 big cities (Florence, Venice, and Romagna) have 5 districts, if that is true than each district in AC2 is about the size of 2 or 3 districts from AC1, basically, they’re massive.   Except for Romagna, it’s about the size of a city from AC1, still very big though. Story: play for yourself, because I would be happy to spoil it for you if you message me, but I do not want to ruin the incredible story for you.   I have not played such a good story since MGS4, Infamous, or AC1 (haha, just kidding about the last one). Graphics and Animation: Just like how AC1 was head of its time for graphics, so is AC2.   AC2 is up there with some of the greatest graphics of all time.   However, the animations are pretty repetitive but each one is satisfyingly bloody and just simply look awesome Buy this game, it is so far the best game to come out in 09 and if you say it is not as good as MW2… I will be so pissed. Overall: 9.8/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed 1.5?       Altaïr's blade was never cold for longer times  In short, no, but let's face it, the game's core is nothing new from the previous, it's everything around it that has changed.                   Assassin's Creed had an appealing story and the somewhat interesting character                  Altaïr but it the lack of content around it made it incredibly tedious and bland to play through. Don't get me wrong I plowed through that sucker with a gleeful smile to my lips as I cut fools from left to right out of simple mischief. The problem was that I had to create my own challenges to survive the boredom of doing yet another flag run or pick pocket missions. Like playing with a hand and a foot or trying to complete a side mission without blinking my eyes. While that in it's own can be fun it's not exactly the experience I payed for. I could just go outside and pretend I have friends in that case.    I'll leave it with that and continue with my impressions of Assassin's Creed 2 and why it's not just a 1.5.  Desmond, meet Ezio  The Animus 2.0 looks more inviting and cozy  Assassin's Creed 2 starts out with the re-appearance of                 Desmond Miles but this time around he feels more aware of his surrounding and playing him doesn't feel like a drag. Something you realize in the first minutes as he and                Lucy literally fight their way out of the               Abstergo complex.  Naturally the game revolves around the blade of an assassin so it's not long before they arrive at an assassin safe house and Desmond is introduced to the new operatives              Rebecca and             Shaun who together show him to their version of the            Animus. It's not as advanced as the one at Abstergo and it shows immediately on the ingame HUD that has lost that radiant and high tech design in favor of a more simple and clean one. It feels a bit strange at first but it does feel like an intelligent design when thinking about why. From here on Desmond and his new friends will only make a small number of appearances compared to AC I but they feel more natural and interesting. Instead we're following the story of    Ezio Auditore di Firenze, the Italian nobleman of Florence. Unlike Altaïr, we're following him from birth all the way to his thirties and most importantly through his youth where a big portion of his family is betrayed and sentenced to death.  This is where Ezio must assume his father's role as an assassin and uncover the truth behind the          templar conspiracy. And it's this that draws me into the story because it feels like he's properly learning how to be a cold, blade wielding assassin and it's more clear to what drives him.   The Renaissance Men  Myths and conspiracy theories at its best.  Ezio will meet a lot of interesting characters that really existed during the renaissance and the most impressive addition is a Q-like take on         Leonardo da Vinci. The renaissance is the home of many stories, legends and myths and Leonardo's supposed inventions is the primary example of this.  Ezio is not like Altaïr, he does not already know the secrets of the assassin. He finds them in the shape of codex pages. Codexes that incredibly few can solve, Leonardo being one of them.   He'll supply Ezio with tools such as the twin blades, hollowed out blade for poison attacks, increased health and even a small wrist mounted gun to really kick the myths behind the inventor into gear. This offers huge motivation to explore the cities and uncover map sections to find the codex pages. That together with the        subject 16 truth, a series of video snaps that together offers a startling revelation. These are hidden behind glyphs that are strewn throughout the cities, finding them can feel a bit tedious but the building descriptions are kind enough to alert you to the proximity of one by an icon of an eye in the corner of the picture.  The Game he Plays  Can you see me now?  The game play in Assassin's Creed II handles more or less the same like the previous one with a few smaller changes. Ezio is a noble and he walks like one, instead of hiding by praying he hides by walking among the crowds of people and you can actually walk around without alerting guards, so long you're not notorious.   You can lower your notoriety by taring down posters, bribing, or killing corrupt officials. Once you're not notorious you can walk freely and it feels more plausible to blend as the clothes are closer to what most people wore during the renaissance era.    There's also more tools against the guards, toss gold on the ground and some of the lower ranked guards runs up and begins to pick them up while the officer is left to be killed. Or throw a smokebomb and you can calmly leave the area while they cough and wave their arms around blindly. It just generally feel like you always have the means to get the upper hand on even the strongest of opponents.    Aaaaaa! Not again!  His movement is exactly like the first one, hold down the trigger and he abandons his walk and begins to run, jump and climb rapidly.  This is both good and bad as you again feel like this agile and fast parkour artist that leaps across the rooftops to your goal... so long you're doing it like the designers wants you to. Doing complex jumps left and right or trying to jump from certain walls to the other can prove fatal as Ezio many times does a leap into thin air and falls to his death. They have been more clever in the design this time around but in the Assassin tombs this became painfully obvious when you have to do wall jumps to catch timed levers or swing points.  Sometimes Ezio really work against you. I got a job for you. it's different, I swear The mission structure is the same like the first game, run to a mission trigger and work your magic after the ingame cutscene. What stands out here is the fact that the work around you do before you go in for the kill of a major character feel more different and weaved deeper into the story.  Instead of doing your fifth pick pocketing mission for some shred information, you sneak around the canals of Venice to acquire guard uniforms or you tail officials by using hired courtesans as a cover.  There are still proper side missions but they also feel more worked on, like assassination missions that can wary between killing people in unarmed combat or tossing them off rooftops to make it look like an accident.      Money, feathers, Villa! Best swords in town!  The money you earn from the missions or pickpocketing are used to upgrade your equipment, buy new throwing knives and even used to renovate your own personal city. The Villa will offer you a steady income of more money and discounts from the stores you upgrade, something that can be appreciated at the ends where new weapons comes at quite a hefty price.  The Villa will also become your gallery of stuff you collect throughout the game. Paintings are hung on the walls as you buy them, armor pieces that no longer are used are placed on dummies and weapons on racks for display. It genuinely feel like you do progress even while doing tedious feather collection as there's in-game feedback and reward to everything . (not to mention the kindness from the developers to show exactly how many of what you've collected in each city) Final WordsAssassin's Creed II is a treat throughout and I had a great fun doing everything, including the feather hunting. The Villa motivated me to scavenge entire Italy for the missing pieces and the clues within the Truth was incredibly interesting to dig through. Even if it felt like Ezio's story fell a bit in the backseat at the end it still felt interesting as it was delivered in such a way to describe the future of the assassin.  Being able to play the game with Italian voice was interesting and a thankful way to add more depth to the renaissance era you play in but something I eventually switched back to English for more ease in following dialog. And there's no real replay value apart from continuing the game to find all of the collectibles for achievements, but I still felt a certain level of fulfillment by the end of this game instead of the otherwise emptiness. DLC to continues Ezio's story a bit more would always be welcome but it's not a necessity to increase the value of this game. While there are some hiccups in the movement and some annoying repetition in NPC dialog, I'm satisfied and it was worth every cent in my book.   I would even dare to go as far as to say this is MY game of the year in terms of experience and feel while playing.  Played Assassin's Creed II on the Xbox 360, using the Black Edition extra content. Completed it in around 50 hours total playtime and had collected everything but the feathers before the final Mission.   Played an extra 3-5 hours to collect the full 1000/1000 achievement points.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The crux of my review is going to be this: the developers have done the thing which earns them the deepest respect of the gaming community, they took what they had which was good, figured out what more was needed by listening to US, and then put those two things together into one stunning masterpiece.  The first title had a lot going for it. It's root, Prince of Persia, had always been horribly linear when you take into account that it's movement system is FREE-running, so producing Assassin's Creed was a great idea. Everyone loved roaming free on the rooftops above the heads of the commoners, dispatching guards with lethal finesse. The brutality of the combat was murderously entertaining, although the combat itself felt almost the same every time with the limited number of death animations, only one type of enemy (not including bosses), and only 5 weapons. The stealth worked very well too, although lacked in options. But apart from that the character of Altaïr didn't develop a whole lot, so story was limited to the overarching conspiracy, and connection with Altaïr (the game's main playable character) was never really felt. Also the missions were all pretty much the same, only a few variants of different missions just put in different locations, without a whole lot changing from start to finish in how you would actually perform the assassinations. Basically, with the missions and combat, variety was an issue. In AC2, however, they resolved these issues, while building on and improving all that was good. They made the movement even more fluid, the controls more intuitive, and removed some small silly things that fans complained about (guards realising you're an assassin simply if you gallop on horseback, and Altaïr's inability to swim for example). They increased the variety in architecture too, from small run-down Monterigionni to the pompous, sprawling waterways of Venice. The combat is now much more varied with different types of guards for whom different tactics are necessary, a much greater variety in customizable weaponry and armor, items like the smoke bombs which you can drop to create a cloud of smoke which you can use to escape, and a lot more (awesome) kill animations. Stealth now has many more options i.e. poison, dual assassinations, better air assassinations, assassinations from over ledges and in hiding spots, drop-down assassinations, the list goes on. Also the use of recruitable courtesans, thieves and mercenaries, all of which can be used to distract guards from their duties, aswell as the ability to pick up dead bodies and place them so as to distract the guards. The (non-lethal) poison is handy for getting past guards without raising the amount of alarm that bodies do. Now, the over-arching conspiracy is becoming truly intruiging with MUCH more depth, as well as the fact that Ezio is a massively deeper character, who we follow from birth to the end of his purpose, while we watch him develop from a harmless young noble into a lethal but now truly noble assassin.   This game has much more variety in general. I can barely pick any issues with it, you can now actively decrease your notoriety level and change how guards will react to you, there are now random courier events where you can choose to hunt down a target and take his riches, not as a mission but just someone you happen to chance upon in the street. Any crowd can be used as cover now, not just groups of monks. Ezio's clothing can now be changed with dyes and he has his own small city which he can invest in and upgrade how he sees fit, with building upgrades or paintings et etc, which earns him income. You can control gondolas on water, horse-drawn carts on land, and Leonardo's flying machine in the air. The missions are all varied with practically no two the same during the (pleasantly surprising) 16-18 hour singleplayer story, making it much more gripping, and the basic assassination, beat-up or race type events are now entirely optional sidequests, but with a lot of unlockable depth. On a less core point, the graphics are stunning and the achievement points are incredibly well allocated, encouraging you to get a taste of each of the many facets of the game rather than to fully complete everything. I also like the fact that DLC has been announced that will bring us back to the game in the months to come, as it sure deserves it.  My complaints about AC2 are few. Occasionally, the movement controls aren't quite understanding you and you end up running up the side of chairs when really you want to be out of the room, but it doesn't happen often and isn't a major concern, and crucial moments of the game like big assassinations appear to be mapped out specifically to avoid this. The game has also at a few parts taken qeues from it's origin in Prince of Persia and some indoor tomb section which occasionally use a fixed camera have been included. the fixed camera though forces you to use the thumbsticks to control Ezio from your plane of view and not relative to Ezio, so for example you might be viewing from the side and wanting Ezio to jump from one beam to another, left to right. Ezio is facing away from the beam on the right, so you hold down (meaning to jump behind Ezio) and press A. This instead results in you jumping directly towards the camera, and is frustrating, but again it is only very rarely a problem (3-4 times during my playthrough at most). It also warms up rather slowly IF YOU PLAYED THE ORIGINAL A LOT, with the player only getting completely drawn into it about 2 and 1/2 hours in, because at first it is mostly teaching you the stuff that you could already do in AC1. So to sum up, it's in my top 5 games ever, and I have the utmost respect for what Ubisoft did with the series. The best praise I can give it is this: I have earned all 1000 Gamerscore on it, but seeing as I've barely scratched the surface of some aspects of the game (the sidequests mainly), I'm still going to put the disc in tomorrow and carry on assassinating, hunting, swinging, jumping and racing. By Abercromby3]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Ever rarely does it seem that a sequel to a loved, albeit flawed, sales hit ever deliver on it's promises of fixing every problem and adding on more than what was ever to be expected. Assassin's Creed II not only manages to fulfill it's duties as a sequel by addressing the most notable issues encountered in the first game, it also does so much more to improve itself that it amounts to an incredibly satisfying and fulfilling experience.   People can never be pleased on the internet, it seems. While generally well-recieved by fans and critics, the first Assassin's Creed suffered from a few issues that were voiced loud and clear by it's players. Unlike most situations, Ubisoft Montreal actually took the care to listen in to everyone's complaints about the first game and quite literally made what could interpreted as the perfect sequel. Along with having a story that actually is quite good, the game is almost double the length of the first, even after removing all of the open world tediousness of horse-back riding and the infamous ""flag collecting"". The main story is now filled with interesting and lively characters and the most dreaded fault of the first game, it's repetitive mission structure and lack of side-mission variety, is almost completely nullified. There are still some issues but what ultimately makes Assassin's Creed II great is what also makes you forget about those problems.  One of Leonardo's many contraptions Achieving the Platinum trophy after 25 hours of play and beating the main story somewhere around the 17-18 hour mark, Assassin's Creed II is a significantly longer game than the first. The game will take you through a much greater variety of areas and the story you'll be playing through is much more engaging than the first time around thanks to some great characters. The game instantly picks up after the first Assassin's Creed with you controlling Desmond Miles as he escapes Abstergo with Lucy, the female assistant from the first game. You proceed to meet a group of individuals who have their own Animus machine, dubbed the Animus 2.0, who recruit you to unlock the secrets of the Assassin order and answers related to the Templars and their relic conspiracies. In the Animus, you'll play as Ezio Auditore di Firenze, a young Assassin who's father and brothers are murdered due to a political injustice in Florence. Ezio seeks out answers as to why his family is killed, how the Templars tie in to all of it and what are the pieces of Eden both the Templar and Assassin orders are chasing. The first game essentially had you acting out an agenda with no real emotional tie to all of it, so it's a huge breath of fresh air for Assassin's Creed II's main character to be so vocal and likable. Along the story you'll meet a bunch of supporting characters, the most notable one being Leonardo da Vinci, and they will take you through many areas like Florence, Tuscany, Venice and Forli. Speaking of which, the game is doused in historical references. You'll be helping out the Medici family early on and move on to meet many characters involved in Renaissance history like Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI). You'll meet them in extremely accurate portrayals of each city filled with perfect-to-the-tooth recreations of the landmarks found in each one. If you're unaware of the history like I was, it's dazzlingly interesting stuff. If you're well aware of the history, it's super-interesting to see how they tie everything together while still staying marginally faithful to their source material. The story will introduce a fair amount of sharp turns you won't see coming and the end of each chapter will always leave you wondering just what is waiting for you next. It really ties in together super well and makes it well-worth playing through. That shouldn't even be a problem, I personally couldn't put the controller down once I got halfway through. It's pacing is great and the momentum the story has is terrific.   You can't see it, but the frame rate's like, badUnfortunately, I bought the PS3 version. The story sure can have momentum but the game's performance sure doesn't. Not on this system, at least. I've yet to try the 360 version but the PS3 version runs pretty terribly. By no means is it unplayable, it never ever got in my way and never made itself more than just an unfortunate disadvantage. The textures pop-in frequently and the draw distance is rather poor but the biggest offender is the frame rate. It's never consistent and will more often than not drop between the 15-20 range. Not just in crowded areas, either. You could be facing the ocean and it would still drop. I've no clue why, it's not like Ubisoft has never made a game on the system before, it's just extremely unpleasant and makes it kind of a bother when you notice it. The animation on the characters is fantastic, thankfully. Ezio will move in silky-smooth fashion (when the frame rate isn't chugging) and cutscenes are acted out incredibly well. The only problem I had, really, was that apart from Ezio, who is intricately modeled, most of the characters in cutscenes look rather fugly up close. They look a little blocky and choppy, some textures just looking outright awful. The terrific voice acting is there to divert you although accents can take a little adjusting, considering they're obviously going for ""We're going to make you understand our conversations"" instead of ""Historical accuracy"". Even then, it remains quite stellar. Better yet is to put on some of the foreign tracks. The game offers you the ability to play the game in italian with subtitles, though I played a good part of it with the french track on (I'm from Montreal so I tried to see just how good the french track is) and it's quite well produced. For people who don't understand the language, it's entertaining but for those that do, it's incredibly well acted and the mannerisms are much more accurate in french than english. I would assume it's same for the italian track.  Assassinations return (duh), just this time you don't need to spy on one dude from a bench every hour to do soThe graphics are really where I'm done complaining about issues in the game. The rest is all gameplay and it's gloriously refined to the point of being a standard for open-world games. The most important thing to point out is that the repetitive mission structure and nature of the original Assassin's Creed is gone. ... Seriously. It's over. No more 3 mission types. No more flags. ... DUDERS. Seriously. It's worth the 60$ right there, christ. But no. Ubisoft just, you know, had to sweeten the deal. How 'bout every mission being it's own type? How about side-missions having a bunch of sub-types to offer up so much variety you'll never feel you're doing the same thing twice? That good enough? It's basically the difference between GTA: Vice City and San Andreas. The first had terrific ideas but was hampered down by the fact you were essentially doing the same 4 missions over and over with just a different dialogue happening before, during and after the mission. San Andreas had every mission be it's own thing. You were still doing Point A-to-B, shoot until X, drive here, etc. but it was handled in a way that always made it fresh and different. The same can essentially be said for Assassin's Creed II and it's what makes it tirelessly entertaining. It will have you clawing at your own brain for more when away from it. The free-running is still here and slightly improved to make climbing and such a bit more fluid, though the ""having jump and run on the same button"" thing can get a little infuriating when you're running one way, trying to jump another and miss your leap completely. It's  nothing climbing the way you went can't fix, but still. The one thing I found a little weird was how the rooftops and such were designed. The first Assassin's Creed was designed in such a way that the rooftops really were the best route to go if you were trying to get somewhere. In ACII, the rooftops seem so much more complicated and varied in design that it makes it rather difficult to just speed through roofs. It had me relying on city streets more often than not and it took a little getting used to. It's not a game breaker or anything, perhaps it's just the rooftops in the Renaissance era are more complex or some dumb hogwash like that. Oh, and Fast Travel stations. That's right! No more horse-back riding across desolate deserts and areas devoid of excitement. Wanna go from Florence to Venice? 100 florins!  While on the subject of money, there's a lot to spend it on. Which is a good thing. 'Cause by the end of the game, I had 460,000 florins in my virtual pocket. About an hour or two in the game, you will have to flee Florence to your family's home town of Monteriggioni where you can spend money to upgrade the town's decrepit stores and vacant lots to attract tourists and merchants. The city upgrades, you get tax revenue and the better the city, the higher the revenue. Buying paintings from art dealers, completing Armor sets, finding items in the world- all of these contribute to the Villa's value and you get a cut of the tax revenue every day. I was getting about 50,000 per game day-cycle. That's every 20 minutes, another 50,000. You can buy armor upgrades, weapon upgrades, throwing knife ammo, smoke bomb ammo, poisons, health packs— there's a fairly vast amount of things to spend your money on and luckily the game will be more than happy to throw it at you. (Or you can throw it at the crowd, up to you.) All the upgrades affect your health, attack power, attack speed and counter-attack effectiveness. You can also spend your money on Treasure Maps that will show the locations of chests sprawled across the world containing more money. Spend money to make money. Along with the treasures, there's 100 feathers located throughout the world that you can collect, viewpoints return from the first game and the new addition this time around, the glyphs.   Care for a swim? The glyphs are symbols hidden in the world by Subject 16, a former Abstergo captive like Desmond. Subject 16 discovered a deep truth about Abstergo and has encrypted his finding in separate glyphs that you find on walls of the game's many historical monuments. When you decrypt a glyph, you're faced with a series of puzzles that uncover the truth behind the Templar's interest with the Assassin order as well as their role in world history. It's all super-fluous and it's territory explored by other mediums, but it doesn't stop it from being so interesting that you'll wish it was actually true so you could study up on this stuff. The whole Abstergo/Templar fiction the game elaborates on is some of the most engaging fantasy I've been exposed to in a while, despite being the whole world conspiracy/new world order jargon crazy people go on about. If you know a little bit about the Knights Templar, you know there has been rumors since their very conception of their involvement with holy relics and conspiracies around their rapid rise to power and injust dismantlement. The game just takes all of that and pushes it to a level far beyond you could possibly imagine which makes you, in the end, think two things. One makes you think what could possibly come of the game after the end of this one and the second, what the hell the Templars actually were. I'd suggest you read up on them if it interests you, it's some incredibly interesting history.  The Abstergo fiction and plot is super interesting. Desmond doesn't care, though. He's way too serious for that shit.  Assassin's Creed II isn't just what I wanted out the first game or what I expected out of a sequel. It really is an accomplishment as to what an extremely dedicated team who adores their fans enough to listen to every single one of their complaints, while still moving forward with their intended direction, can do. It plays better than anything else in it's genre, it has an extremely engaging story line and establishes a fiction that could be explored for many more entries to come, it looks and sounds beautiful and best of all, it's fun for every second it will last you. You need to buy this game. It's an absolute must-play for anyone who remotely enjoyed the first and if you didn't, you'll probably like this one too since it fixes all of the problems you most likely had with the first. If this is the product of developers listening to fans and critics, there's no excuse for not supporting it. Assassin's Creed II is, by far and large, in a league of it's own and at the top of it's genre.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The First Assassins Creed was a love it or hate it kind of game, most praised it for the expansive environments filled to the brim with people and featuring some of the best animation in the industry. It was however attacked, rightly so, for a lack of variety in the core missions. The team at Ubisoft Montreal as set out to address these issues in the sequel.     Assassins Creed II begins at the exact moment that the first ended, our real world hero Desmond staring at the strange matrix like code on the wall. Anyone unfamiliar with the first game will be at a significant disadvantage to understanding the greater story arch here, AC2 gives almost no time to try and fill in newcomers to the millenia old Templar Assassin war, let alone the DNA memory device that allows Desmond to relive his ancestors memories. All we are really told is that the Templar's seek a artifact called the piece of Eden to control the world and we, that would be the assassins want to stop them. Thankfully we are dropped back into the animus and in our 15 century ancestor Ezio Auditore shoes fairly quickly. Despite some misgivings about the game being set in 2021 and all of our actions being merely in a machine I enjoyed the forth wall breaking in the first game, the game within a game. The sequel keeps us lock up in the animus for 90% of the game although they do a good job of keeping the feel of being inside a program, the comparisons to the matrix are obvious and numerous. Bits of code will fly from your target, messages from the machines operators will arrive in the form of historical descriptions of Italian landmarks and denizens. It is all quite well done and give the game an artificial feel.    When we do arrive in Renaissance Italy, we are dropped into the baby booties of Ezio, we experience his birth and then shift to him as a young adult. The setting 15th Florence, a place and period almost never explored in gaming. Banking and the arts rule the day. A breath of fresh air in an industry filled with Medieval warriors and Elite special forces. The team in Montreal must have spent a great deal of t research into the various places and characters of the time. Peppered throughout are detailed examinations of real world buildings and historical characters of the era.     Ezio is the son of a wealthy banking magnate and it takes a bit of time to get to the meat, that would be the killing. After some explosive events young Ezio is thrust into the dangerous world of murder. The Story is very well done and after the initial slow start it ramps up and pushes forward on a quest for vengeance and answers. Focusing on Ezio's assassin training and search for answers the story is  well told, it can be a little confusing at time, Maybe it was all the Italian names, but I found myself wondering who I was attempting to murder at times. Never the less a thrilling very fresh story of  Renaissance brutality.    Leonardo da Vinci takes time off hiding codes in his paintings, to help young Ezio on his journey. Leo builds various devices and machines for our assassin, chiefly among them is the much hyped dual hidden blade; as much fun to use as it sounds. Leaping from rooftops and simultaneously piercing the sculls of two targets never does get old. In fact Ubisoft did such a good job keeping the art of killing fresh I found myself wanting to go back and seek out extra missions, and the various hidden items, as the credits began to roll.   The most major fault with the original was undoubtedly the lack of variety and the general feeling that you had done this all before, eavesdrop on an informant, tail a lead, beat information out of a suspect. All leading you to the whereabouts of your target. This strict system of information gathering and assassination as been all but forgotten here. The story now flows much more openly and fluidly. Story missions are endlessly different and leading Ezio. It stays fresh as we move from city to city gathering information and exacting our revenge. Side missions litter world and are much more varied then in its predecessor, there are plenty of races, courier delivers, beat downs and assassination contracts to keep you filled. I found myself eager to complete the extra tasks as the game now sports a monetary and equipment system. In addition to upgrading your weapons and armor, your home base now acts as a small investment property, the more money you put into town shops and mansion improvements the more florins you receive back.      The violent combat from the first game has returned mostly intact, with many more weapon choices and even the ability to disarm and use opponents armaments, combat has been expanded with more depth. Counter kills still rule the day, quick timing is required to perform a brutal, I may say beautiful kill. More heavily armed and armored adversary's do take I bit more to get through, a more skillful use of dodges and strafing are required. Free running and climbing are still very smooth and the superb animation continues thought the game. Some small miss steps are possible with the sprinting, this can be annoying in your more challenging platforming tasks.      Rising industry star Nolan North once again finds his way into a game,he is quickly becoming the go to guy for gaming characters. Voice acting is quite good, authentic cliched Italian accents a plenty. Only issue here is the facial animations, Ubisoft flaunted there ability to replicate Kristen Bell's face during the first games hype, but the facial textures are beginning to show there age. Graphics in general have not held up as well as would have hoped, the vistas and the shear size are truly jaw dropping, at ground level the closes ups of characters have really been left in the past, Games such as Uncharted 2 have shown us the future are it looks good.    Through out the long campaign: lasting a good 15 to 20 hours. Ezio is attempting to unravel a conspiracy century's old. Tracing its roots back to the crusade times of the first game. All set within the vast political and economic backdrop of Renaissance Italy. Assassins Creed II succeeds in almost every way a sequel should. Writing every wrong. Time and care was put into making AC2 what the first should have been. Vast cityscapes, incredible animations, vicious and exhilarating combat, and one of the deepest and well paced story's this year. It stands with the best action adventure games of recent memory.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[                First of all, I absolutly LOVE Assassin’s Creed 2. In fact I would venture to say that it is the most interesting video game franchise out today. It takes you to exotic new locations and times, introduces you to some of the most influential historical figures of all time from Richard the Lionhearted to Leonardo Divinci. I love this series.                    That being said, this is one of most infuriating games I’ve ever played. The original Assassin’s Creed still tops my list of most frustrating games . This one falls very far from competing with that coveted title, but, in its own right, it has some flaws that make themselves apparent throughout the course of the game.  The problem is that this game is so elegant and awe-inspiring most of the time, that when it doesn’t go your way, it instantly stands out. The best way I can describe it is that Ezio does not work well under pressure.  When he’s chilling out, jumping around the city, he is very responsive and knows exactly what you want him to be doing. But when you are being chased, chasing someone, or trying to maintain a time restriction, which happens often in this game, the gloves come off in a big way.  It seems that when Ezio gets flustered his first response is to jump directly off a tall building. I found myself having to keep a well-stocked medicine pouch not due to formidable enemies, but to counter-act the inevitable time when Ezio decides to jump of the side of whatever building I am currently climbing.  Accept when I am actually trying to jump off a building, that’s a whole different story. If I am trying to jump off the roof of a building Ezio too often daintily stumbles off the edge and grabs the side. At which point I hammer the B button so he will let go and take the fall like a man. Again, by itself, this seems fine, but when I need to move fast this whole maneuver takes chucks out my precious time.                  The Story is amazingly crafted and thrilling but, at some point, it feels like I am no longer avenging Ezio’s family so much as I am killing all the sketchy business men who ever talked to Rodrigo Borgia. The minute an old, fancy dressed man comes into frame; Ezio takes out a personal vendetta on them. Many times throughout the game It would have been very easy for me to simple run up and stab the game’s main antagonist and Ezio’s long journey for revenge would have been fulfilled, but instead I cannot. Players criticize Assassin’s Creed for being repetitive and boring but at least I felt like the game set a goal and achieved it.                  Also, some missions require you to “remain unnoticed” where in you must maneuver around the guards until you get to your target at which point, you slaughter someone in the middle of a street. It doesn’t seem necessary to be so stealthy when, no matter what I do; the inevitable conclusion will be open combat. It is a game play mechanic that is understandable but seems not believable in this context.                  One more complaint: During the middle of the game you run into a rag-tag bunch of thieves that partner with you to take down a tyrant in Venice. The thief girl (I don’t remember her name, big surprise) runs past you and jumps up a building in broad daylight, in the middle of a city packed with archers and guards. She gets shot with an arrow (no, really?) Suddenly you, presumably a complete stranger, take it upon yourself to rescue this girl from her half-assed plan. After a few minutes of her and her thief friend barking orders at you to kill the guards like it’s your responsibility, you arrive at the hideout/ alleyway by the docks. These thieves struck me as the most incompetent band of misfits in Italy. I could not make myself respect or even like these characters (Antonio is cool but, come on man get it together).                   OK, done with the bad stuff. Ultimately, none of these thing s detracts from the overall amazingness of this masterpiece of a game. This is my game of the year. The level of character customization is fun and engaging. I find this game so fun to play that I find myself going back to the game to get all the achievements just to have a reason to play it. There were times in this game where I just enjoyed watching Ezio scaling buildings and jumping through the air and finding myself in disbelief of how beautiful this game is. In fact, I am rapidly running out of things to do in this game. I have bought all of the painting, weapons, armor and upgrades. I found all the glyphs, and beat all the Assassin’s Tomb s to unlock Altair’s Armor and fully renovated the villa. (By the way, did anyone else find the architect a little off-putting? It’s like he was saying “Hello Ezio, give me money”)                   Without mentioning it in details I will say that if I wrote down exactly what happens at the end of this game, it would sound completely ridiculous. In its simplest form this game seems like the work of a madman, but through skillful writing, amazing graphics, some of the most satisfying platforming of this generation and Thorough character development, Ubisoft has managed to make it into not only my favorite game of this year, but a landmark achievement in the history of video games.                         ]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Ubisoft gets it right, here's for my review of one of my favorite crack addictive games of the year. Available for the Xbox360, PS3, and sometime next spring for the PC. I give this game a well deserved 9/10. The Good - So Ubisoft took what was a solid engine built to be the first title and made a real game out of it. What ever do I mean? Well, part 1 had a fairly nice graphics engine, cool premise, huge open world, and probably one of the best climbing mechanics I've seen in a game. Problem? There were like 3 or 4 objectives that you could only do and once the novelty of playing as an assassin, scaling roofs and whatnot got old....there simply wasn't much game there, repetition was the worst enemy of that game. Fast forward 2 years, we have the sequel, which has you playing in Italian Renaissance times. You're a guy in the present, in a machine, tapping into the memories of one of your ancestors who happens to be in a lineage of assassins. You'll spend most of your time as Ezio, who dons a hood and cloak much like Altair in the 1st game, but much more stylish of course. Not only that, Ezio is way more interesting, his storyline in drawn out with interesting turns that really make you give a damn. Once you're built up to full assassin status, it's straight bad-assery here on out. Just about all the problems most people had with the first game are fixed here. The cities are interesting and bubbling with life, there's ton of missions/objectives to do...not only are they not repetitive, they're pretty fun to do. It's one of those games that'll have you going, ""just one more mission"". You can change and upgrade your weapons load out now, along with armor, and even change your look by going to tailors and have them dye your gear. It really taps into that vanity of games some of us just get sucked into. Of course the big stars of the show, the climbing and actual assassinating. Climbing feels pretty much the same as I remember, which is fun and dynamic as Ezio grabs whatever's nearby to maneuver. That system still works pretty well. Fighting I feel is improved, it's easy to get down the rhythm of things, and complex enough that you might not even do half the moves unless you take the time to learn them. And the assassinations are as satisfying as ever, you get plenty of different ways of dispatching your enemies. It's easy to get out of 'notorious' status to resume operations, unlike the first game. So you're not always on edge, the game wants you to have fun. Finally, there's fast travel....no more riding horses for 10mins. at a time and worrying about getting attacked. Overall the game is pretty forgiving in it's difficulty but challenging enough to still be really fun. Lots of hidden stuff keeps you coming back for more. Long review here I know, but hey, the game's great and it's huge and the campaign is really long, I'm only scratching the surface. The Bad - As solid as the controls are, there are times where Ezio will make a jump or turn where you just didn't want to. As you learn how to perfect the controls, you'll see most of that is your own fault, but it shouldn't be so easy to screw up. Minor beef there, hopefully will be fixed with the next game. The flying that was made so much as a big thing this past E3, is only present for one mission, that's disappointing. The Ugly - Trying to remember what actually happened in the ending.....man, they take such a left turn and try to cram so much info is so little time it's insane. It's like taking a person who got sucked into the 1st season of Lost, then flipping the script being like ""you know they're gonna be time traveling 4 seasons from now right?"" Totally caps your head up.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Ok this game from the start i was like ok wtf is going on now i did play the first one and loved it but i didnt fully understand what it was all about and the ending just made me go ??? so yeah now that i googled some info about assassin's creed  now i kinda understand what happend so anyhow the graphics are somewhat good  the reason i say this cause the character models are really not that well made you can't really see whats soo good about them but as for the towns it is very well designed i aswell googled some more and i found out that some of this places are as well designed as the real thing :D so for that it self i think it just makes it more awesome so the gameplay i had no probelm with it everything seemed to worked as it should they could have added a few more stuff like really use two weapons, wall running stuff like that - you can wall run but thats just up to hold on something to get to the top of a building anyhow now as for the Story as i said this is one of those games you got to look it up on the internet to really understand whats its all about aswell unlock all the puzzles to see a mini clip won't say what that is but yeah i will say this the all game is based on 2012! =) OOH NO NOT THAT AHHH!!  now now come down it really does make a good point of what could happen - not the end of the world but who knows yet :P we will see i guess - ok so i give this game 4 and a half stars cause its not  perfect as it does have its parts that doesn't make much sense but i guess thats why they making part 3 now :P aswell no online play or co-op - i mean come on who doesn't  want to play with a friend two players and kill everyone in town ? :P i know i DO! ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The first Assassin’s Creed was the fastest selling new IP in recent memory and for good reason! The ability to climb virtually anything and assassinate evil doers in ancient times appealed to a huge audience. But the first game felt unfinished in many ways that prevented it from being as good as it could have been. The sequel attempts to remedy this but does it succeed or will Assassin’s Creed 2 just more of the same. The big thing that hindered the first Assassin’s Creed was the way it was set up. EVERY mission felt the same. You’d climb to the top, talk to someone or maybe follow someone in order to gather information on the target; then find and kill them. After awhile this became incredibly boring. Thankfully Assassin’s Creed 2 has fixed this with a more traditional approach to telling its story. This time you go to a location and active a story Grand Theft Auto-style. I would certainly say that many of the missions within the main story are still far too similar to one another, but there’s no doubt that this is a welcome change and the whole game flows far better because of it. The story itself and the main character Ezio are far, far more interesting than Altair ever was and because of this you’ll feel compelled to keep playing. Another thing I find so much more interesting is the setting, which takes place in Italy during the Renaissance era.Graphically, Assassin’s Creed 2 doesn’t look a lot different from the first title. It doesn’t look bad but it is kind of dull. Pop-in is plainly visable in many locations along with lots of other weird glitches throughout the world. Still, when you’re riding through the mountains or observing Florence from high above, you will certainly find yourself in awe. It should also be noted the architecture that they've managed to capture is simply incredible.The music is well done and while it’s nothing groundbreaking it’s suiting and epic. The guards as well as the cities residence have MUCH, MUCH more dialog compared to the first game. This helps to really make the cities feel alive. Battle sounds are impressive with plenty of clanks and clashes. One thing I did notice though was that while I was on my horse riding from one location to the next I would cross a bridge and the sound effect was no different than if I was riding on normal ground. A minor gripe but noticeable none the less.Gameplay is a real mixed bag. When your climbing these massive structures that are centuries old, heading towards your next target, it’s pretty amazing. But in situations where guards are chasing you or when you’re doing something that is timed and have to get to the next location fast, the controls will go janky on you. For example, while hanging you’ll intend to jump to the building on the other side but instead the controls will misread your action, you’ll jump to the side and into some water. In many ways, Assassin’s Creed 2 doesn’t feel much improved from the first title in this respect. Combat against enemies is really pretty boring. You lock on, wait for them to attack, press a button to counter-attack, rinse and repeat. On the plus side though, there are a lot of nifty new weapons to change things up a little bit but you’ll find yourself going back to what works more often than not.Assassin’s Creed 2 does a lot of good things. The story is intriguing and will keep you playing to the end. The five cities are enthralling and large (especially Venice). Climbing massive world-renowned structures as you move about is awesome but tends to get tedious towards the end of the game. Likewise, combat is incredibly bland and cumbersome. So, for all its good, Assassin’s Creed 2 can also be incredibly frustrating at times due to its numerous flaws. I just don’t feel the sequel does enough to improve upon the previous game to warrant a $60.00 purchase. However I can say that it’s an excellent rental. In the end, two words describe Assassin’s Creed 2 best: highly overrated.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Assassin’s Creed 2 is a MUST BUY for anyone that doesn’t mind murdering people in a video game in creative and fun ways. The End. It has 20-30+ hours of gameplay featuring amazing character animation, tits graphics, OCD detail, accurate history, and huge environments. The game features accurately recreated Renaissance era cities of Florence, Venice, Romagna, and the Vatican. You also get to own, operate, and upgrade your own castle villa! Assassin’s Creed 2 is a definitive game of the year contender for 2009 and a significant upgrade from AC1. Just wish it was longer, had more RPG/simulation elements, and well, more everything.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[        The sequel to one of my favorite Xbox 360 games finally here. Does this make up for all funky parts of gameplay or does it create more bad parts.               Positive: Extraordinary visuals Improved gameplayStunning and emotional storylineMore assassination techniquesEconomy systemGreat Voice ActingInteresting puzzlesFun challengesA variety of side missionsCustomization of armor and weaponsExhilarating rivalries and assassinations         Negative: Some sloppy jumping at times              Overall this sequel overcomes it's prequel by a mile long shot. With more missions, weapons, an economic system, and customization into the mix makes this one of my favorite games of the year.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 1: side mission, side mission, side mission, assassination, side mission,... end of game. Assasin's Creed 2: Escape, Street Brawl, side missions, story, murder, escape... Perfect. Ubisoft really stepped their game up for AC II seeing as some people think that it is the best game of this year. They killed their formula, upped the combat, the story, the missions, everything is just better. The game throws platforming, story, combat, and stealth to create a near perfect game. It was a little glitchy, but it was so much fun. I don't think there was one character that I actually disliked at the end of this game (save the little brother). I beat this, and may beat it again before I think about selling it. The replay value isn't that good, and the game plays until the end, but after a certain point you can just do no more, or you won't want to. It is a great game, and if you have a choice to get this over most other games, this is the way to go.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[                Assassin’s Creed II sees players once again taking on the role of the franchise lead character,                Desmond Miles, as he once more delves into the past of and ancestor. This time it’s               Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young man of some standing in Renaissance              Italy. The story quickly picks up from the end of the first game, with just enough recap to catch fans back up to speed, but not enough to fill in some of the more major blanks for newcomers, so the game assumes some familiarity with             Assassin’s Creed. This isn’t too bad though, as the new story soon develops itself, with Ezio getting a fully realized story, showing of one of the biggest improvements in Assassin’s Creed II, a lot more character and believability to its story and hero.     Whilst in Ezio’s shoes, players will find themselves exploring all over later 15 century Italy, living the life of a once nobleman on his quest for revenge after events early in the story mean his life takes a drastically different direction. The story lends itself well into tutorials, with the player learning as Ezio does, and it flows smoothly enough without ever dropping too much on you at once. Also, the next part of the story is always available, meaning you never have to go and do side missions to get to the next part of the story, letting the game progress at the players choosing. Assassin’s Creed II also breaks up Ezio’s story much less than the first game did with    Altaïr,with just enough returns to Desmond to keep him in the picture without diverting the player away from Ezio and his story. Technically these are small improvements, but they do make Assassin’s Creed II less polarizing than its predecessor with simple things like explaining why Ezio is murdering all these people in the first place.      Gameplay wise, Assassin’s Creed II is very similar to Assassin’s Creed, however many tiny improvements and additions make the game much more accessible and varied. Ezio has many more weapons at his disposal, as do his foes, as well as more ways of using them, making combat feel more functional than in Assassin’s Creed.           Counter attacks are still one of the best ways to dispatch guards, but with new disarm techniques, and the use of the            hidden blade in face to face combat, there’s a lot more choice and freedom to dispatch your foes, often in some gruesome ways. Which is a good thing, as the AI of the enemy’s has also been refined, thereby making guards more of a challenge than a test of how well you can use the counter attack system. Assassinations have also been greatly improved by adding more variety, be it simply taking out two targets at once with the twin hidden blades to the more extravagant stuff life assassinations from rooftops with dramatic leaps, or more useful things like Assassinations from hiding spots. Sadly, the combat never gets too hard, and while no one method can dispatch every enemy you’ll encounter first time, once you learn the disarm skill you rarely ever need to use anything else but that and the hidden blades.    The          free running and exploration is much more of a mixed bag. Much like the first game, Assassin’s Creed II suffers from its path finding seemingly being random at times, with it sending Ezio in a completely different direction to what you intended and expected. However Ezio also moves better than Altaïr, climbing and moving faster, and just having more moves at his disposal. But this just means its all the more frustrating when an otherwise great traversal system sees you suddenly going somewhere you weren’t expecting. With landscapes as big and varied as those of Assassin’s Creed II allows players to traverse through, these issues are often one event’s and a little more forgivable. Another great thing about the environments is that there’s always something to do or collect, meaning you’re rarely ever running from place to place with nothing between the two points to do, and the inclusion of   fast travel makes getting between the major locations a lot less of a chore. All these parts are brought together well by the story missions, varying from following someone through busy streets, to flying over  to infiltrating buildings and assassinating targets.      Aside from the main missions that progress the story, there’s also a whole ton of side stuff to do in Ezio’s . Between assassination contracts, beat up events, courier jobs and races, a lot of the core gameplay is used a lot. The best part though, is that all these side tasks are fun in their own right, though sadly, sometimes more fun, and importantly, challenging, than the actual main missions. There’s also a lot of collectibles to gather as well, ranging from useful weapons and  armour  to more cosmetic stuff like paintings. Add these to hidden treasures and an upgradeable villa, and Assassin’s Creed II has a lot to keep you busy. It’s best side mission though lies in Subject 16 and glyphs hidden on specific buildings, which when found reveal puzzles that unlock parts of a story not vital to the   plot of the game, but add a lot to the series’ fiction.    Visually Assassin’s Creed II is gorgeous. The locales all have their own feel and style and there’s little to no immersion breaking architecture, no buildings look climbable that aren’t and vice-versa. All the character models look great too, from the humble street beggars to the suave looks and dashing attire of Ezio. With no slowdown even with a screen full of people Assassin’s Creed II maintains a constantly high visual standard throughout. The only exception is Lucy Stillman, one of the characters Desmond interacts with whose face just doesn’t seem to look right next to other characters. The high levels of standard set by the visuals are also maintained in the sound. All the characters are well voiced, with none of them sounding out of character or scene. The music is often understated which adds to how good it sounds by not being overused or overpowering. However, if I never hear “Money, Money!” in an Italian accent again, it’ll be too soon. Also,  Cam Clarke seemed to be pulling double duties on voice acting smaller parts, I seemed to hear him as much as I heard Ezio.    Assassin’s Creed II is a really great game. As you plow through the main story, there’s always something else you can be doing too, and with characters and a setting as solid as the game presents, it’s a joy to follow through. But once it’s done, it’s done. It’s a fair sized game, but added to its ease and few frustrations, it just falls shy of excellence. That said, Assassin’s Creed II tells an incredible tale, and is an utter joy to play, and thoroughly worth experiencing. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[     Its a Bird! Its a Plane! Its a Flying Italian?     The first Assassin's Creed  blew on to the scene and kind of took the industry by surprise. Most new IP's that come out don't have the draw like Assassin's Creed did when it launched which led it to sell remarkably well. But that doesn't mean it did not come without baggage. The lack of mission variety and repetitive nature of the game left people wanting more.        AC2's story picks up right after the first AC left off with Desmond Miles in a near future still being held captive by Abstergo Industries who's ultimate goals are still up in the air. In the fiction of the series throughout history a powerful organization of templars (Abstergo) have been at odds against a group of assassin's trying to prevent whatever the motives of the templars may be. Abstergo is using Desmond's DNA which has a long bloodline of these rival assassin's to sync back up to significant historical time periods. Using what is called ""the animus"" Desmond lays in and is synced into a virtual world a la the Matrix. One of Desmond's faithful friends is back Lucy Stillman a spy for the assassin's, using her advantages of being a Abstergo employee in undercover she helps bust Desmond out. Traveling to a secure location Lucy and her team use Desmond and their own animus "" which looks like a tanning bed"" in hope of him gaining the ability's of his ancestors.  Hows my color?      Jumping into the animus is where the real game play actually begins. AC2 ditches the almost bland time period of the Crusades for a more vibrant and robust Renaissance Italy. You play as Ezio Auditoire de Firenze, yeah a mouthful. Ezio is young and brash, and has much more of a personality then the previous games main character Altair. Certain events that happen throughout the story lead Ezio to slowly become a deadly assassin motivated by revenge. Most of the game is built around platforming and a parkour style traversal across these historical Italian City's. Unlike Altair, Ezio's climbing is more graceful, and flows much better. Lots of variety in combat with new weapons, the addition of a second hidden blade, and a pistol in his sleeve. Dude how much stuff can you fit in this guys sleeves. Also a lot more mission types then the first AC, whether it be race challenges, collectibles, or assassinations. I found myself completing the assassin tombs, and looking for glyphs to decipher mini puzzles within the game to unlock a secret video called The Truth. The game also introduces its own in game economy, giving the player options to purchase upgrades for health, paintings, new weapons,  different armor and dyes for your outfit making Ezio feel very customizable. Also you can invest money you earn throughout the game into your smaller base town Monteriggioni increasing its economy and actually changing the atmosphere itself. The inclusion of Leonardo da Vinci had me on the fence at first but the way they utilize him is very well done. As Q is to James Bond,  Leonardo is to Ezio.        Not to say I didn't enjoy Ezio's story but I'm much more interested in the overlapping story of Desmond and Abstergo. But the story has to be looked at as a whole, all parts are important. Lately even the most high quality games that come out have very underwhelming or lack luster endings. This is where AC2 shines its brightest, if there was a game of the year category for best ending AC2 would win hands down, at least for me. It's worth to note that the game did freeze up and crash on me once (PS3 version). But overall Assassin's Creed 2 shines where the first didn't, from the gorgeous atmosphere, and variety in the game play, this is one of the better games of 2009.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The Assassin Creed Redemption  The first Assassin's Creed was just bursting of potential to me.  The repetitive missions that were required each time that unlocked the assassination main missions were a pain. Abra-ca-dabra they gone! AC2 is definitively one of those sequels that fix most of the sore thumbs from its predecessor . It still has repetitive missions but thankfully they are optional. The scripted scenes and cut scenes are now of a GTA quality with camera angles and close ups to see emotion, instead of walking around in circles as i await to get back to free running. I love that the speed of running and climbing has increased that makes traversing the beautiful city's of AC2 fun and fast. Combat has a ""real"" feel in that even though enemies have health it's more like a duel of skill, not chopping health bars down. Ubisoft has really put a lot of detail and subtlety in AC2's mechanics. Being able to extend your arm and jump to catch higher or father ledges is a big help. Walking fast, blending in crowds, assassinations from a ledge, commerce, f**king swimming, row boating, and many more improvements on the first makes it a hard recommendation to even play the first Assassin's Creed .     WTF WOW!!!     Ezio's story is far more interesting, with a tragic introduction that really had me pulling for him all the way. I never understood all the intricacies to Ezio's plot. I just knew the general story and  I had to kill all Templar's. Desmond's side of the story was always what i wanted to know more about and Ubisolf definitely delivers. I would say more happens in AC2s first 6 minutes then in the first iteration,at least on Desmond's side for sure. The end of Ezio's quest of vengeance will weave his and Desmond's story lines into a revelation that makes the AC's universe much more meaningful than you could ever imagine or see coming.   50-50 My only problems with AC2 are some control issues and game play story situations. Having the X/A button being jump and free run is a frustration sometimes. This was most a problem in the Assassin Tombs where there only one pathway to progress ( think Prince of Persia: Sands of Time ) and having to retry because to that. I also disliked the fights where you could not assassinate certain characters without a warning that you can't because for plot purposes. This would lead to me hammering on the X/[_] button or trying to counter with hidden blades to no effect, except losing health. Running back to your town to acquire money and/or change armor was a hassle if not redundant.  To the Score Lookers   Assassin's Creed 2 is very much worth a gamers time. There is enough relevant game play variety and story to keep someone hooked for days. Rent or buy, Assassin's Creed 2 is a game you should check out.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[          You may remember the first Assassin's Creed as a game with some really cool ideas and great graphics, that was brought down by some significant flaws, like the fact that the entire game basically consisted of the same 5 mission types over and over again. I personally loved the previous game, being able to look past these shortcomings, but a lot of people did not. Thankfully, Assassin's Creed II intelligently builds on what made Assassin's Creed great, and throws in a lot more content and mission variety. Thanks to this wise approach, Ubisoft has crafted a sublime game that, if you were in any way interested in the first game, you are sure to enjoy. It is just plain better in every way.    Ezio is even more lethal than Altaïr Assassin's Creed II picks up moments after the rather open ending the previous game concluded with. Desmond is still wondering what the hell happened, when Lucy comes and drags him out of Abstergo, beating up some guards along the way. After the rather exciting escape, Lucy informs Desmond that they must initiate his training to become an assassin himself. And thankfully, some sort of process in the brain allows him to do so in a matter of days, by diving into his genetic memories and copy moves and routines from his ancestors.  It's an excellent excuse to jack back in, but this time around, you won't be taking control of the bad-ass slayer of crusaders, Altaïr. Instead, Ezio Auditore da Firenze is your man. You actually meet him as he is being born, and from there, a long prologue about his adolescence rolls out. Ezio is young and care-free, tempting girls, rolling in his father's money and brawling with the opposing families of power in Fiorentina. However, after an hour or so, lightning strikes, and all of a sudden, his life gets turned upside down. From there on, Ezio aims to punish those who have wronged him and his family, and his desire for vengeance is totally justified.  However, when you think about it, Assassin's Creed is about Desmond. Unlike the first game, where Vidic will pull you out of the Animus after just about every mission, in Assassin's Creed II, you only get to see the control room very sporadically. I counted three times where you took control of Desmond. I thought that was kind of too bad, because, while Ezio's resolve was something I could relate to, I was way more interested in the real-world antics of Lucy and Desmond. It was hard to shake the feeling that what Ezio is doing isn't of great consequence, and he even states this himself. Right at the end of the game, a single event blows the lid off and completely reveals what's going on to Ezio in one fell swoop. Though the missions are much more varied this time around, the game quickly falls into the same pattern of “acquire intel regarding target, and then take him out.” Young Auditore kills quite a few Templars over the course of the game, but only the very last kill actually seems to do something. That was a bit disappointing to me. However, this flaw in story development is made up by the fact that the ending is mindblowing. Marvellous. Fantastico! The game's conclusion sketches some very exciting prospects for the inevitable sequel, and makes the whole ride worth it.   A change of scenery is always nice Assassin's Creed II improves and expands on the first Assassin's Creed's gameplay in every conceivable way. Altaïr was pretty good at his job, but Ezio is just better in every way. The free-running has been streamlined, to enable Ezio to scale buildings even faster and make Altaïr look like an old man. The combat has also been expanded, with lots of weapons to buy and pick up, armor to buy, moves to learn, smoke bombs and more. Some new enemy types have been added, although they don't change the feel of the combat all that much. You can, unfortunately, still be surrounded by enemies and simply stand still, countering and killing them as they take turns attacking. The window for countering is absolutely humongous, so this tactic is almost too easy to apply. Still, the combat manages to look good at all times.  The “Social Stealth” has also been improved upon. Previously, hiding in plain view meant that you had to walk along with some priests. Somehow, the guards would not notice that you were the only priest armed to the teeth with swords and knives. In the new game, however, any group of two or more NPCs can be used for Social Stealth. It's not necessarily more realistic when guards do not notice you as you are walking along with two prostitutes, but it is quite cool when you are just running along with a huge crowd and you can laugh at the ignorant guards.  Like I said before, the core pattern of “kill, kill, kill” is still here, but this time around, there's some stuff to get side-tracked by. There are plenty of side-missions, like races, delivery missions and other random errands. I didn't really get into them too much, but it's nice that they're there. Ezio is a rich man, and he is the landlord of Monteriggioni. The town villa is in pretty bad shape, so you can busy yourself with spending money upgrading the place and making the village more profitable. You've also got the horrible collection quest for feathers, this edition's equivalent of flags.    Firenze and Venezia are even more exciting cities to explore than the previous game's locales One significant extra is the Assassin's Tombs you can explore. Imagine playing Prince of Persia with Assassin's Creed's platforming mechanics. If you do that, then you'll have a pretty good idea of what these tombs are like. In order to find the reward that lies at their end, you must jump from pole to pole, climb walls and look around in first-person to see where you're going. It's awesome. I'm not sure if this is a testament to my love of Prince of Persia or a negative for Assassin's Creed II, but some of the most fun I've had in this game was solving the platforming puzzles under those churches. It shows just how much the free-running, although automated, is capable of.  Another distraction are the symbols you can find on certain prolific buildings that you can find. They present you with a puzzle, and if you solve that puzzle, a piece of video will be unlocked. Unlock all twenty pieces and you will witness something that is mind-boggling, much in the same way as the game's actual ending.  If there are two words that permeate Assassin's Creed II, they are most definitely “Italia” and “Renaissance”. I have a distinct love for both subjects, so this game hit my weak spot. As Ezio, you will be running across the beautiful vistas of Firenze, Venezia and a couple of other less prolific, but just as fantastic villages. The game boasts lots of historical facts, and throws them in your face in rapid succession. Run past a church? Update! Meet someone, like, I don't know, Leonardo Da Vinci? Update! Get a new target! Update! You'll build an entire databank of information, and although Assassin's Creed II is obviously nowhere near historically correct, there is still of trivia to shove into your brain here. Some of my favourite churches have been accurately represented here, and I found myself actually stopping and looking at the recreated artwork on their walls. I love Italy, I adore Italian. I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, to hear a good amount of Italian sprinkled throughout the conversations. If you are looking to learn some Italian nouns, you might learn something here. There is an option to set the game to being entirely Italian, which I promptly tried, hoping that the spoken Italian would only apply to the memories. Somewhat disappointingly, however, Desmond also started speaking Italian (and who would want to remove Nolan North from his game?) and the lip-syncing was off for obvious reasons. So, I begrudgingly flipped the switch back to full English, alas.    Italia, ti amo! Assassin's Creed II looks extremely good, much like its predecessor did before it. The draw distance is fantastic, the buildings really get the look of the Italian città down, and the animations look superb. All that splendor does come at a small price: even when installed onto my harddrive, I saw a lot of textures loading in too late, and materializing as I was running past them. However, it is a minor issue that I could usually ignore pretty easily. The music and voice-acting are good, and the database menus and such excellent. The second Assassin's Creed does not disappoint when it comes to presentation.  Assassin's Creed II is just a fantastic game. The feel of the first is still very much in here, so if you disliked how that game played, you may not be swayed here. However, a lot more content, more evolved gameplay mechanics and a story that begs for more make this a game that you really ought to play, and one of 2009's best.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I wanted to like the first Assassin's Creed, but found the mission structure too inflexible. It was a nice looking game, and I enjoyed the running around on rooftops, but the actual game content wasn't what I'd hoped.  Assassin's Creed 2 fixes those problems. While the mission structures are often similar (you eavesdrop, track, and murder, followed by an escape), individual mission feel so much more open and free that it's almost an entirely different sort of game. While the first game's missions felt formal, structured and linear, AC2's feel more  organic. There's no busywork here. Missions are straightforward, complicated only in ways that are reasonable (no flag collecting, for instance).  Aside from the main missions, the assortment of side-missions is eclectic and interesting. Even the assassination contracts manage to set up some interesting obstacles. There are a few cookie-cutter missions, but even those will often throw you a curve.   I have mixed feelings about the tomb side-missions. While they are (admirably) very reminiscent of Prince of Persia in their platforming, on occasion the system takes over the camera control, usually during time-sensitive sequences. That might sound like a help until you realize that the controls have subtly shifted, meaning all that work you put into getting Ezio to move smoothly and predictably has gone out the window.  And that takes us to the controls. Most of the time, Ezio's movements are smooth and the animations wonderful. However, it is far too easy to misjudge edges and find yourself jumping into the gap between buildings rather than, say, nimbly climbing across the ropes connecting the buildings. This can be avoided by slowing down on approach, but somehow that just seems wrong in the context of a fast and furious chase through the streets. It's infrequent enough not to be a huge negative, but the game could certainly use some more refinement there.  The game is gorgeous, save for a few minor flaws. The female facial models in particularly are ... disturbing. Mouths too big, often grotesque facial animations. You have to wonder what they were thinking. But the movement animations, from walking to running and jumping, are all fantastic.   As for the story:  I found myself more interested in Ezio than the overarching conspiracy/end-of-the-world story they handed us. Ezio's story is wonderfully fleshed out in the first hour of gameplay and then left to flounder. Revenge. Okay, I get it. But I wanted more about Ezio, and we just don't get it. Instead, we get a lot of tired conspiracy-theory claptrap that has been done to death over the last ten or fifteen years. It's all rather silly. The writers took a kitchen sink approach and threw in just about every kooky conspiracy theory out there. It comes off as being ambitious, sure, but in a high-school creative writing class kind of way. Sorry to say it, but it's my honest impression. Less, in this case, would have been more.Tired story aside, the gameplay here is solid and fun. In short, it's an excellent game, a huge improvement over the last, and I can say that I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2 was extremely hyped for fixing everything that was wrong with the first game, and glorious review after glorious review told me that it didn't matter that the I thought the first one was underwhelming, because  this one was ""everything the first one should have been"".  I can totally see where people are coming from saying that it is a more fleshed out experience in terms of characters and storytelling, because those aspects are definitely improved from the first Assassin's Creed, but in terms of actual gameplay quality, I honestly found this game just as lacking as the last. Some of the thematic differences in AC2 from the first are ones that probably hint at a gameplay difference, but in reality don't actuallly change much.  The dual hidden blades is the most glaring of these: you still just press X to off somebody, and if there are 2 guards right next to each other do you really think there still would have been 2 if you only had a single blade?  This is a choice that really just changes animations, and while those are cool, make no mistake that double hidden blades is the exact same from a gameplay standpoint as one hidden blade.  The inclusion of all the different types of equipment in general just feels somewhat wasted.  You can have a sword, small weapon, hidden blades, poison blade, throwing knives, gun-thing, smoke bombs, and probably some others that I'm forgetting equipped at the same time.  These are thematically all kind of neat, but realistically I only ever fought using my sword or just straight up unarmed.  That's right - unarmed.  With all the multitudes of weapon choices in the game, Ubisoft thought they'd make the game ""harder"" by making enemies that you can't block or counter, making unarmed fighting easily the best option in the game.  Another frustrating feature added to AC2 is the assassin's stronghold.  This is your base of operations that you can upgrade to make money and get discounts at shops, and it is also where all your equipment is stored.  I can't understand for the life of me why I had to run all the way back to my stronghold to change equipment or get my income every 20 minutes - it seems like the money could just be deposited into my wallet instead of an extremely far out of the way chest, and I'm pretty sure nobody would care if you put an ""Change Equipment"" option in the pause menu.  The last big sore spot for me about AC2 is just the general traversal problems I had.  I fell off of rooftops all the time because Ezio didn't do what I wanted him to quite right.  Ubisoft made Prince of Persia, and that game had excellent platforming even when on much more complicated set pieces than anything in AC2, so I just don't understand why those mechanics just felt so off.  All that being said, AC2 isn't a  bad game.  It's just not the improvement over the first that I was lead to believe it was.  As I said, probably the best thing about the game was the character development and plot progression, well, excluding the end sequence of the game.  Unfortunately, this doesn't make up for the still very bland combat, unsatisfying and sometimes annoying platforming, and the other annoyances like the frequent trips to the stronghold.  If you really loved the first Assassin's Creed and are up for more of pretty much the same thing, then Assassin's Creed 2 is your game.  If not, you might want to think about getting out of the franchise now, because I don't see it going far away from it's bajillion copy selling formula any time soon.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I had a high appreciation for what Ubisoft sought to accomplish with the original Assassin's Creed, but was one of the many that felt like its gameplay never lived up to its ambition. It was ultimately a shallow, repetitive experience, and I was hopeful that the sequel would make strides to better realize the original concept. The result is double-edged, as the narrative aspects bring a much better flow to proceedings, but that coating does little to hide the lack of evolution in gameplay. Assassin's Creed II plays very much the same as its predecessor, and will primarily appeal to its fans as a result.   With that being said, Assassin's Creed II is ultimately a better game than the first. The main reason for this is that its narrative is much more well developed. Rather than simply being told ""kill nine dudes"" right at the start, you follow main character Ezio Auditorie de Whatever as he evolves from an irresponsible young man into a master assassin. You take it one mission at a time, and a lot of smaller characters and plot threads work their way into the mix along the way. It ends up being a fairly rich tale, and the story flows in such a way that seems to give much more meaningful context to what's going on. This in turn makes it a little easier to get into the nuts and bolts of the gameplay.   Unfortunately, this sugar coating can only assist the gameplay so much. The basic gameplay design of Assassin's Creed II is essentially a ton of glorified fetch-quests, which get old fast. Whether you're delivering a message, escorting an ally, or simply trying to kill someone, almost every quest in the game boils down to getting from Point A to Point B. The action you then do at Point B is generally something trivial, such as talk to someone, or kill a few people. And make no mistake- killing people in Assassin's Creed II is as trivial as it gets. I played through the entire game by countering or disarming opponents, which are essentially the same move. It's super easy and totally unsatisfying. It also didn't help matters that I found getting from point to point kind of frustrating. Most of the time everything worked fine, but every now and then Ezio would jump in the exact opposite direction from where I had him facing. I only died once in the entire game, and that's because Ezio decided to jump left off the Duomo, rather than forward like I instructed him to. It just felt a bit wonky. Finally, the silly economic system felt pretty tacked on to me. You'll always have enough money to buy whatever you need, yet having to travel all the way back to your estate to pick it up is just lame. It all felt like one big distraction, simply put there to needlessly extend the length of the game.  Repetitive mission structure, easy combat, and wonky platforming. These are the exact gripes I had with the original Assassin's Creed, and the sequel is no different. A more well structured narrative provides better context for your exploits, but this cosmetic face lift wasn't quite enough to blind me to its underlying shortcomings. Fans of the original will certainly find a better package here, but anyone looking for some significantly improved gameplay would be best served elsewhere.  For additional information on my review style and scoring system, click       here.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2 despite being a nightmare to spell did not really spark my interest at first. The main reason for this is that I was so excited to play the first one and when I did I was hugely disappointed, the main campaign was a drag and those few good moments were not worth the grind. The thing was the game quickly picked up some buzz and after expecting a half arsed cash cow, I was pleasantly surprised.   The game starts you off exactly where you left off staring at the wall of your room when suddenly, well lets just say some shit goes down. Finally you get to do something with Desmond other than wandering around a room. This sets the premise for the rest of the game, while still not taking a huge role you suddenly realise why he was there in the first game. You are quickly back in the animus though, this time taking the role of Ezio a charmer and a womaniser who is a character you literally follow from birth. You also swap the holy land in the crusades for a blossoming renaissance Italy which looks stunning and it really can't be captured in screenshots.  The game works in the same way as the first which for you newbies means a large thriving open world split into several cities such as Florence and Venice. All over the world there are missions scattered about as you come to expect nower days and I am pleased to say these missions, from the core story to the side missions, are a lot more fun and diverse than the first game. The key thing is that these missions make you feel exactly how you want which is a complete badass. You will stalk your prey, mingle with crowds and secondly free run across the city to escape capture. The combat system is deep enough for you to master without being overwhelming and never gets boring. The story in AC2 is a lot more fleshed out than the first story and actually makes the original seem better for it. You follow Ezio through his life you find his motivation for becoming an assassin in the first place and how he gets pulled deeper and deeper into the whole conspiracy pulling the games together. You will meet rich and interesting characters such as Leonardo Da Vinci and the Medici family. You also find a lot more out about Desmond and he quickly changes from a 2D character into a interesting part of the story. A new economic system also kicks in and it is surprisingly addictive upgrading you villa and buying new armour. Assassins Creed is not perfect however some of the games new systems are not introduced particularly well meaning it took me quite some time to figure stuff out. Also with such a complex free running system you will often get caught on parts of the scenery. For example a couple of occasions where i was trying to be stealthy I suddenly ended up jumping across walls.   Assassins Creed 2 is perhaps the game we all wanted from the first although this is by no means an apology for the last game. Its brilliant world and fresh interesting story makes this game lots of fun despite its issues. This game stands on its own brilliantly but perhaps more importantly validates the series as a whole.]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Currently, the video game industry is driven by sequels; rather than risk a lot of money on a new series, game companies would rather stick to a franchise that has previously proven itself.   Unfortunately, developers do not show any signs of relenting any time soon, so if they are going to maintain an entire medium mostly through sequels, they should at least know how to do it. Assassin’s Creed II is a prime example of how to make a sequel.   The first way it proves this is by   detaching   itself from the previous game. Rather than rely on the previous game’s story entirely, it instead gets the original story of Desmond’s fight with the Templars out of the way to tell its own story.   This time, you follow the story of Ezio, a Florentine noble turned assassin. Like the last medieval assassin Desmond shadowed, Ezio must slowly build himself up from the bottom, something that may disappoint those looking for a more direct story. However, unlike Altair of the original Assassin’s Creed, Ezio experiences greater character development; Ezio kills because of personal reasons, not because   he is told. His ultimate goal is not to repel an invading force, but rather to avenge his father, whom his targets have killed. All this expansion of the protagonist’s role in the story   makes for a slightly more believable story and world, something   Assassin’s Creed II excels at. Things like continued development of cities, characters speaking Italian, and an affable cast of characters taken straight from the pages of any history book make it quite easy to become immersed in Renaissance Italy  , even if the copious conspiracy theories   and sometimes cartoony graphics   somewhat mar that immersion  .   Fortunately, your victims' death speeches have shortened significantly.  Given the nature of the game,   a highly detailed world is almost necessary;   there are many reasons to explore   Italy  , and a poorly constructed world would become apparent rather quickly.   Aside from a wider variety of means of travel (horse, boat, swimming, etc.), there are also   many hidden objectives to be found, each with proper motivation. While some of them are new to the   series, like the sometimes-overly-cryptic glyphs   which expand on the story   and Prince of Persia-esque tombs that unlock better armor and weapons, Assassin’s Creed II also improves on several features that its predecessor introduced. The first that comes to mind is the viewpoint system  . It was a satisfying way of uncovering areas of the world in the original, and that has not changed here. What has changed is their complexity, the variety of moves with which to climb the towers, and what they reveal now.   Specifically,   they reveal   that there are   fewer   cities than there were before. One of the few areas where the original Assassin’s Creed surpasses its sequel is level variety; while the original game had you constantly traveling   between a variety   of cities all throughout the game,   its sequel prefers restricting Ezio to one city for a long time before moving onto another one of a small collection of them.   The trade-off seems to be that each city is larger, making for a larger medieval playground in which you can climb and jump.   A large part of the game consists of jumping from building to building in search of   targets  , effectively shrinking the environments quickly.   One of Ezio's new moves is the ability to kill enemies with their own weapons. Yet while the number of cities to explore has deteriorated, the number of things to do in them has improved immensely. The most significant addition is that of a currency system, allowing you (among other things) to   buy health potions, bribe guards, change the color of your cloak, upgrade your armor, and purchase new weapons. No longer are you limited to swords and knives; Assassin’s Creed II presents you with a variety of ways to kill enemies, even if some of them aren’t very useful (pistols, poison daggers, etc.). In addition, battles now have much more strategy to them than before;   enemy health is now displayed upon lock-on, and while fights can quickly decline into violent button mashing   affairs,there is a myriad of moves, each with their own specific purpose and strategy. Of course, a lot of the moves and weapons don't serve as an important a role as they should, but for those who wish to use them, they work well and are often satisfying to use.   In fact, one theme that seems to run throughout Assassin's Creed II is that while some of the improvements are decent, they are not exactly necessary. The example that best illustrates this point is Ezio's country villa: in theory, it should be a completely customizable mini-city, since you can buy town repairs, build new areas, and fill the nearby mansion with priceless paintings and armaments you no longer use. The motivation is sufficient, as upgrades will give you discounts on high level items sold only in that town, and repairs increase the value of the villa, translating into more money regularly flowing into your pockets. However, the problem that causes the entire concept to crumble is that it just isn't that fun; your small town feels less like a customizable area of the game and more like a checklist you may or may not complete throughout the game. The only reason to bother with the feature at all is, as mentioned before, the regular flow of money it generates. In addition to purchasing the best weapons and armor, you will constantly need money to refill your vulnerary and weapon supplies, both of which drain somewhat quickly as you naturally progress through your missions. On the subject of missions, they comprise some of the most notable and distinct changes in the entire game. A common complaint directed toward the original Assassin's Creed was that the missions were repetitive and followed too similar structures, and it is very pleasing to see that Ubisoft has made it their goal to mend these flaws in Assassin's Creed II.   For instance, you are never permanently aimed at your assassination; the mission structure of this game is more laid back than that of its predecessor, allowing you to branch off into side missions and explore the city at your leisure. During this time, you can take up any number of side missions, ranging from races and chasing thieves to stealing valuable objects and exploring grand tombs. The reward for each one varies greatly, ranging from a simple cash reward to chances to unlock the best armor in the game, although a lot of them do not have any reward whatsoever. Again, there is a trade-off: unlike the original Assassin's Creed, these missions are not necessary to build up to the actual assassinations. However, this, when combined with the meager reward they offer, makes you wonder why they even bothered adding these side missions in the first place.  For example, thieves will taunt guards into chasing them to the roofs. After all, the actual assassinations have improved immensely. They build up over a series of smaller missions, tackling things such as finding a way to get to your target or fighting off a small army the enemy has sent to deal with you. Obviously, this means that they're more complex and varied, as are the actual assassinations. Killing a target no longer requires that you follow a group of scholars to your target and then unsubtly stab your foe. Sneaking through the streets of Florence is very refined and presents you with many options; you can distract guards with a dead body, freely follow a group to your target, or hire a group of mercenaries or thieves to distract nearby guards (each in their own specific way).  This freedom does not end when you meet with your target, as there are many ways to take out your target. You can overtly challenge them to armed combat, but other options include spotting them in a crowd and sneakily stabbing them, or even assassinate them from a distance with your throwing knives. More often than not, the easily provoked guards will catch onto these plans before they can be implemented, leading to a conspicuous fight, but the fact that these options are present is enough of an improvement. Besides, it is always possible to dart from rooftop to rooftop in order to escape your pursuers.  However, the game is not without its flaws, the most notable of which is that it's slightly more bug prone than its predecessor. Things like odd vehicle physics, AI anomalies, and graphical flaws can hurt not only the way the game works, but also the immersion so much of it has established thus far. In addition, the overall quality starts to deteriorate near the end of Assassin's Creed II, as it forces you to do things like complete a collection and use skills that were never used before to see a somewhat illogical ending. Overall, though, Assassin's Creed II is an excellent game that fixes a lot of the flaws of its predecessor, making the core gameplay much more enjoyable because of it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Late last year when downloadable content was announced for Assassin’s  Creed II I was definitely excited. The second game in the  franchise was a vast improvement on the original in nearly every way,  and earned its place as one of my games of the year for 2009. Both  pieces of DLC, Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities,  will slot into the vacant spaces for memory sequences 12 and 13,  filling out blanks in Ezio’s story rather than expanding upon the events  at the end of the game.  Finally get that Achievement As a result, the story in Battle of Forli is difficult to  understand if you haven’t played Assassin’s Creed II since its  release back in November. Picking up straight after the close of memory  sequence 12 it carries on as though nothing has happened, so if you  don’t remember the specifics it’s going to be hard to follow. Your main  task boils down to helping Caterina Sforza, who you helped on your way  to Venice during the main game. Her castle is under attack due to some  late story implications, so you’re tasked with helping her and her  children, as well as fulfilling some of your own needs. Battle of  Forli also fills in some late story blanks, such as how Ezio got a  hold of the codec map, or why Leonardo da Vinci ended up at the villa.  Only small details, but they at least pad out the story a little more.  The gameplay is essentially part of the main game so there’s nothing  new to see here. The majority of Battle of Forli consists of  large scale battles with a miniscule degree of sneaking and climbing  towards the end. Anyone who’s ever played ACII before knows  that crowded battles were never the game’s strong point so it’s  disappointing that it’s basically all Battle of Forli consists  of. Even Niccolò Machiavelli, one of the most well-known and influential  men in history, is reduced to a combat-hardened sidekick. It would have  been nice to give him a bigger and more respectful role, much like da  Vinci, but at the moment he’s a killer just like you.  More of the same At around 40 minutes Battle of Forli is also an extremely  short piece of DLC. The cheap price of 320 Microsoft Points can justify  it, but for such a small amount of content and the same gameplay we’ve  already spent 15 hours playing, it isn’t really worth it. Newcomers will  get the most out of it since it fits in with the rest of the game as  though it was always there to begin with – arguably like it should have  been – and those wanting to pick up the flying machine Achievement  without going back to play the rest of the game will be pleased with its  involvement. But as a stand-alone piece of DLC Battle of Forli  is significantly lacking in all areas. Hopefully sequence 13 can remedy  things, but I have my doubts after this underwhelming effort. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I ( like many others) really enjoyed the first AC, but realised how much better that game could have been. AC II sets out to do just that, it's an amazing overhall of the originals traversal/ stealth/ action gameplay and a very deep game as well. Unlike the first game, there is actually an interesting story concerning the ""Assassin"" Ezio, even if it simply boils down to the basic revenge plot. It's actually the ties to the main story of AC that makes Ezio's plot so interesting, where Altair's story felt hollow Ezio's does not and it makes the overall story in AC II more satisfying.  But that's just one of the things that makes AC II such a great sequel. There is also a laundry list of improvement's made to the gameplay, here are just a few of them, better traversal, better combat, new weapons and armor. Again, thats not everything thats in here and to tell you the truth I really am enjoying collecting all the feathers/ glyphs and doing sidequest's.  I really found it hard to kind of put my fellings into words simply because I found so many surprises in the game, unlike the first game I actually want to find everything and spend as much time as I can in Italy.   Overall: It really boils down to this, If you liked AC then you probably have  already played it to death, but if you didn't like the first one for it's repetitive gameplay or souless protaganist, then you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. Gameplay 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Sound 10/10 Value 10/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[     Assassin's Creed II is a much more enjoyable game than ACI and improves on many of the faults that were found in the original game. Those very repetitive tasks required for an assassination are gone, and the game instead has a focused mission-based structure this time around. It almost feels like GTA in a way because of the focus of the main character and the many great cutscenes found in the game that progress the storyline and sets up elements that will no doubt be another sequel to the franchise. For right now though, Assassin's Creed II will keep you busy with a great 15-25 hour adventure.   Gameplay options open up thanks to the inventions of Leonardo Di Vinchi The great thing about this game is that it picks up right after the first one. You will still have control to Desmond Miles for a few sequences, but these are more welcome than just walking  to your bed after some time as Altair in the animus. This is great because the original game ended with a cliffhanger and gives players a chance to get more answers that Assassin's Creed brought to the table. Most of your time though is spent as Ezio Auditire da Firenze, or just Ezio for short, the new Assassin Desmond must live as in the Animus. Ezio is a much more developed character than Altair and you get to connect to him in a better way and find out why and how is transition to an Assassin occurs. He's a great character that is accompanied by a great cast of fictional and non fictional characters from history and they will provide you with a great story that will leave questions just as Assassin's Creed did, but will also contain some important answers that will help better understand the conflict between the Templars and the Assassins.   The Atmosphere of the Renaissance is a great element of this game The gameplay this time around is big improvement, with many side activities to do, which are more fun with the better tuned  free-running controls and combat in the game. ACII features many more weapons to wield, including the ability to use the enemies' own weapons against them with the disarm move. Using the groups of people in the world is also a new addition in this game and a key element in certain parts of the story. You can hire thieves to distract the guards by stealing from them, hire mercenary gangs to attack for you, and even utilize the aid of the beautiful courtesans. The game's structure breaks down into completing story missions for the DNA sequences, completing optional side-missions, and exploring the land for many useful items in the game while keeping the great openness of the first game. Overall I felt that Assassin's Creed II was a much more fun and awarding than experience than ACI which is what a good sequel should be.  The visuals are much more improved in this game as well, and with the shift to the Italian Renaissance, ACII brings new locations with many different types of people that populated that time in history in a great and accurate way. They will still react to your actions in the game, but with a greater variety of dialogue.  The great score in Assassin's Creed II is also a great element in this game that really immerses you in the many places you will come across.     Desmond's Role is more fleshed out in ACII So if you saw the potential in Assassin's Creed and suffered throught the gameplay downfalls, Assassin's Creed II is your reward with its great story, visuals, and improvements that the Assassin's Creed Franchise needed.  4.5/5 + A much more improved Sequel and continues the great Story of the Assassins+ Longer game with better side activities to do+ More developed Character in Ezio that makes the story more engaging -Still a little hard to feel like you're in total control of your character- For DLC buyers no new achievements to unlock   How Does it play?   Very similar to Assassin's Creed I, with some much needed improvements How long does it last  ?  It took me about 25 hours to complete while I did most of the side missions Is it a rent or buy?Renting for a week will allow you to finish the game and feel satisfied with the game, and a Buy if you plan on checking out the DLC for the game]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed was a title that quickly became one of my favorites. At times its gameplay was repetitious, but for a majority of the game it swept me away into a world I hadn't thought could exist in videogames. The graphics, the fighting and the movement of Altair, the game's protagonist, was a spectacle that came together nicely in a time period rarely explored by a game.  However, AC1 had its fair share of negatives, and while sales soared, there was much to be improved.  Enter Assassins Creed 2 with a new character and during the Italian 15th century, a particularly important time in history.  Unlike the previous installment, the main protagonist has much more depth and intrigue. Ezio Auditore, the son of a Florentine banker (and assassin) is thrust into action when most of his family is wrongfully executed by a rising politician. While the characters in the first AC came off as a little stale at times, Ezio is completely full of life. Brash, mouthy and determined to exact revenge, Ezio launches a quest to get justice for his family. The story is great, and the character development is also top-notch.  Voice acting and facial animations are decent, while the fighting gameplay is excellent. Some of the most brutal videogame executions take place in AC2, and they're completed masterfully. As Ezio builds his empire and skills, he will acquire new weapons and fighting techniques, which really makes continued encounters a lot of fun.  Graphics leave nothing on the table; the cities of Florence and Venice are magnificent and a real treat to explore.  More than just a great story with good gameplay, Assassins Creed 2 offers a lot more to do than the original installment. Everything from the side missions, which vary greatly, to the ability to customize Ezio's own villa with artwork and weapons - everything offers MORE to do, see and explore.  It's a wonderful polishing of AC1.   There are some downsides to AC2.  The story does lag on for a bit, and some of the assassination targets do lose their individuality as they all sort of meld together. It seems like several may have been tossed in just to boast a lengthy game. The voicework does have a lot of rehashed lines as well. Without giving too much away, the 3rd installment of Assassins Creed will have a lot riding on it. Though AC2 was a brilliantly polished game, it was not an overhaul or a giant leap forward or a reinvention of the series. Fans will be eager to see where the story goes, as will I.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  Assassins Creed II's new  DLC is more assassination fun and a worthwhile return to 15 th Century Florence. There are 9 assassination missions which make up the bulk of this  DLC, and although exciting, they do end up using the same formula; meaning that this is probably a good place to end the Assassins Creed II saga. Following the less than worthy Battle of  Forli, sequence 13 is a return to the heights of the main game and one that fans should be considering. The new area which you get to explore fills in the southern third of Florence, beneath the river on the map. Stylistically the area is like all the other districts of Florence, though it contains no new things to find of any value. The one extra move  Ezio finds is an advanced jump, to do this he sprints onto a pole hanging of the side of a building (with a red banner hanging from it), and automatically springs across the street. Although given this after the first memory, I only used it once in a mission, since it is only possible in the new area. Although a nice touch, it looks goofy and is it seems wasted on just one district. The memories themselves cover the whole of Florence, with only a third starting inside the new district. The bulk of the memories are assassinations of medium to heavily guarded people; but just under half of these missions desynchronize once any guard has been alerted to your presence. This makes some of the Assassinations tedious, but most of them can be completed easily once you know were the guards are and with a bit of patience. Indeed for those who don't like climbing and waiting this pack is not for you, many of the assassinations are best done by climbing around to a vantage point or bail of hay and waiting for the target to walk by. The one problem which is especially apparent while taking your time is how there is very little dialogue, most targets will say about 5 lines, pause, and repeat; this really detracts from the immersion.  Ezio himself is still sporting that beard and still uses snappy and satisfying one liners when in the white world after assassinations. There is a nice reminder of the original Assassins Creed: blending with monks to enter the guarded gates to the city is a clever touch (unless you just kill all the guards).  Ezio also gets to have a nice closing speech, though this really highlights how the sequence was written for use in the game as part of a full play through; and a warning that without playing the Battle of  Forli, the story will make little sense. Another minor annoyance is the fully notorious state that Ezio has early on, but that goes after 2 memories. It is probably a vanity that causes you to buy this DLC: you get to scale the  Duomo, kill some bad people, traverse more of Florence and really just play some more Assassins Creed II. Without achievements or trophies of course it is really just paying for an extension on one of probably the best games of the year. It's a shame that the first DLC was so poor, and indeed that these were not in the game originally is quite unfortunate. The bottom line is that this is a fun, and quite cheap few missions which conclude the story of Assassins Creed II, and save for some minor gripes this is something that all fans of the original should be considering. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed II’s first piece of downloadable content, The Battle of Forli, was a short, underwhelming effort, though it did have some redeemable features, filling in some blanks in ACII’s story and introducing a few interesting new characters. The second piece of DLC, The Bonfire of the Vanities, is short on story elements but it’s a much more substantial package overall, offering a new area to explore and a more traditional brand of Assassin’s Creed  gameplay.  A good old fashioned assassination   Following on from The Battle of Forli, Ezio is back in Florence to retrieve the Apple of Eden from evil priest, Girolamo Savanorala. History buffs will know the priest and the events of the Bonfire of the Vanities, in which he burned items that were deemed sinful, so there’s a degree of historical interest here. However, Savanorala is never really given much of a role; instead, the majority of The Bonfire of the Vanities will revolve around Ezio assassinating nine of his best lieutenants.This set up is very similar to that of the first Assassin’s Creed, albeit contained within the city of Florence and without all of the repetitive investigative work. Instead you’re given nine targets on the map and have free reign to assassinate them in whichever order you choose. Each assassination will provide a certain challenge and a particular skill set, whether it’s fighting your way through guards, infiltrating an area undetected and so on. There’s a nice amount of variety to each target and each area is set up with multiple ways to get the job done. While The Battle of Forli focused on measly escort missions, The Bonfire of the Vanities gets back to what made ACII so good in the first place. Executing a perfect assassination is still undoubtedly satisfying.  The new area is fun to explore, though there's no real reward for doing so    The new area you can explore is fairly sizeable, offering new springboards that change Ezio’s freerunning to some degree, and new viewpoints and templar lairs to explore – although there are still no new Achievements. It’s not much but it’s an improvement that extends the playtime on a much more substantial piece of DLC. However, The Bonfire of the Vanities does carry some glaring presentational issues that dampen the experience somewhat. Audio regularly cuts out during cinematics both with speech and background noise, sometimes both. And some scenes seemed to be missing sound altogether.The Bonfire of the Vanities is a definite improvement on the disappointing Battle of Forli, though it’s still difficult to call it a must-buy. The new assassination missions are a lot of fun if you’re itching to jump back into Assassin’s Creed II again, and for around two hours of gameplay you can’t argue with the price. But if you’ve had your ACII fill then there’s nothing here, or in the Battle of Forli, that will convince you otherwise.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ The first Assassin’s Creed came out of the gate running.   It was a stealth game that had intense action.   It’s construction and gameplay elements were so revolutionary that it had other developers trying to keep up.   For everything Assassin’s Creed did right, it was still a game that had its share of flaws.   With Assassin’s Creed II, it is clear that the mentality going into this sequel was, “Lets make the same game but make it better.”   And make it better they did.   ACII might not be as ground breaking as its predecessor, but it manages to achieve a level of excellence that few other sequels are able to acquire.   The first immediate improvement was the upgrade to the way the story is told.   Unlike the first game, which sucked players back out of the action at the end of every sequence, this title focuses on keeping the momentum.   From the very beginning of the game, which is the last moment of the first, to the crazy cliffhanger ending moments, the pacing is just rock steady.   You are given some story in present time and then aside from a few key points, you are in the Animus playing as Ezio.   Instead of running two stories simultaneously, as was more the point in the first title, you are playing Ezio’s with more of a hint at what’s really going on up until the revelations of the ending.   And the ending is crazy.   Even with the obvious gap for a third installment, ACII still manages to wrap things up in a very satisfying way and leave the audience wanting more, as any good game worth it’s salt should.   The main theme that is apparent when playing through ACII is that it is a sequel that is about more.   More places to go, more things to do, more stuff to collect, just more of everything.   The developers must have heard the cries from critics and fans about the first title becoming tedious with the same thing being done over and over again from place to place.   This time around you will not once feel as though you are doing the same type of thing repeatedly.   Any feeling of repetition is immediately expunged with the sheer number of ways that you can go about solving a particular objective.   There are hired hands that you can utilize to either fight your battles for you or distract the enemy while you slip past.   You can hide in wait and pick them off one by one and no one will be the wiser.   The way in which you can assassinate is just infinitely more robust then before giving you a feeling of choice on how you go about it.   Faults in ACII are hard to come by.   It is indeed an excellent improvement in the formula originally laid out back in 2007.   What problems you might run into are pretty minor, camera not being where you want, landing after a jump not quite where you thought you should be, texture popping, graphic clipping, blatantly lifeless look of the rag doll dead body movement, all things that don’t really detract from the overall experience of the title.   Out of those the one that will warrant the most frustration is the controlling of Ezio when he is free running.   Even with the improvements to the climbing, and the climbing really is a lot smoother then it was before, you still run into times when Ezio jumps in one direction when you tell him to go in another.   This is especially irritating in the Assassin’s Tomb sections.   These are sections that take you out of ordinary day-to-day play of the game and focus almost exclusively on platforming.   While these sections provide an amazing feel of just how acrobatic Ezio can be, and are extremely satisfying when you can do it right, they can also be the most frustrating parts of the whole game.   There really isn’t a way that you can fix a problem like that though.   In a game where it is all about movement and speed, you have a hard time figuring out how to let the player control everything while at the same time helping them in the right direction.   Luckily these tombs aren’t really all that hard and once you get through them you can get back to business.     With a system that is already established as being ahead of the curve under their belt, the only way to make Assassin’s Creed better was to fix all the little things.   In this sequel they have done that and more to give fans exactly what they asked for.   With all of the improvements and the additions, Assassin’s Creed II provides a more complete experience that is both immersive and entertaining.   The development team will be hard pressed to top what they have done in the next installment of the Assassin’s Creed franchise.   This is a title that is highly recommended for anyone who wants a solid single player experience and receives an 8 out of 10 for exceeding excellence in a game.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  Assassins Creed is a great IP. An open sandbox world that's rich, detailed, highly populated, and full ofpotential. With its go anywhere climb / anything mentality, Assassins Creed was one of the best IP'sthat have come out in the last several years. Unfortunately it was plagued with some spottyplatforming, repetitive missions, boring combat, and a very dry main character. On the flip side theassassinations were fantastic, the story was very engaging and was intriguing till the very end, and thecombat (while repetitive) was very visceral and bloody. Now that we have Assassins Creed 2 we get anew character (sort of), an expansion of the story, more combat and a evolved experience that is wellworth embarking on. Story:Again you are following the story of a modern day bartender Desmond Miles, who is a descendant of aancient group of assassins. AC2 picks off right were Assassins Creed left off. After you break out ofcaptivity you are thrown into Animus 2.0, there you are told that you need to learn how to be a assassin(because the first game was for fun) by living through a different ancestors memories in 15th centuryItaly, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio character starts out as spoiled nobleman who is care free andchildish. Very shortly in the game, his life is shattered when his family is torn apart and he is forced touncover a conspiracy of the ones involved. During the quest for vengeance he goes from spoiled brat tofull fledged assassin while killing off everyone responsible. The story is fairly unique in the way that ittells it though great cinematic events that you take part in. From seeing how Ezio is born, to helpingLeonardo Da Vinci move to Venice, or even testing out Da Vinci's famous flying machine, the setpieces help draw you into the experience. To help add to that, towards the end of the game you arethrown curve balls in terms of story that are contrast to what you would expect to see from the ACuniverse. Leading up to a grand finish that left wanting for next game right then.Presentation:In terms of graphics, they haven't really changed much from the first game. But they do look better interms of the details of the characters, foliage, buildings, and water: but only slightly. Its not badbecause for all the activity on the screen of you running and the people below you walking around, itstill looks beautiful, and runs at about 40-60 frames. Going along with that everything is animated veryfluidly. From Ezio running and jumping from roof top to roof top, combat, climbing up the sides ofbuildings, Ezio's movements are stunning. Some of the normal pedestrians do suffer from being stiffand lack of emotion but there just pedestrians. The people that you hire through out the game are nicelyrendered and are very believable with the exceptions of thieves whom look a little robotic and and donot animate well when they are free running (platforming). Wide open fields make a appearanceoutside of all the towns but they feel mostly unexciting and rendering is a little dull compared to therich towns. However it is very nice to ride a horse outside at night (a night and day cycle was added) asit can give you a sense of calm. One of the biggest faults of the first game was that some of the voiceacting was flat. The main character Altair had a American accent when everyone else had a middleeastern dialect. AC2 surpasses its predecessor in every way with Ezio's voice sounding excellent goingfrom young teenager to old man with a spice of revenge, makes his character even more believable. Allthe dialog from the other characters is very convincing and feels genuine. In all the graphics and voicework feels every evolved from Assassins Creed and is a great step towards the third installment.  Game Play:The biggest change between the 2 games has to be in the game play. The combat is brutal, climbing isfluid, a new economy system are great additions. One of the best features added to the game is the DualHidden Blades. Not only does it let you kill 2 people at the same time, it lets you pull off some amazingfinishers that will make you go ouch. The combat was revamped a bit with the addition of differentmain weapons, and hand to hand weapons. Being unarmed is a little daunting seeing how everyone hassharp edges and you only have fists. Well that's fine because you can disarm your opponent and usetheir weapon to kill them. That can range from swords and hammers to halberds and pikes. That makescombat free flowing, brutal, and satisfying. How ever the bad guys will still attack you one at a timeinstead of trying to swarm you. To add variety they made clubs a weldable weapon that have there ownunique feel to combat, though the best weapon in the game is a sword. To help make the game moreexpansive, a economy system was added. While broken, the economy system is a very nice addition tomake it feel like your not doing random missions for nothing. You can buy health potions (as yourhealth no longer regenerates), throwing knives, weapons, armor, escorts, mercenaries, and plenty more.The biggest problem is that its to easy to accumulate money. The village that you fix up is your mainsource of income. After about 3 hours into the game, my village was giving me 15k gold every 15 minfor just running around and doing nothing. While not a bad thing, it really wasn't much of a challengeto get the later weapons and armor. The biggest complaint that everyone had for the first game is that ithad the same 3 repetitive missions. Those have almost disappeared. Now you just have AssassinMissions, Mail Courier, Speed, and beat them up missions. Every mission has there own twist/story tothem to never make them repetitive and boring. The platforming took a big roll in AC2 as one of themain side quests make you go through assassins tombs that require precision and coordination to reachthe prize of a new piece or armor for each tomb. While precision is a little hard to accomplish whichmakes the tombs harder, the platforming is still fantastic. The system all together culminates in nearperfection, with some very small glitches. Conclusion:Assassins Creed 2 could be looked at as what the first game should of been. With great story, graphics,game play, AC2 is a great combination of elements that can keep anyone occupied for many hours.Even through its faults I'm waiting for the downloadable content for AC2 and the 3rd installment thatwill help cap off this amazing series.  www.wickedgamereviews.com]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Love and hate are two of the strongest emotions one can feel. One can’t exist without the other. I absolutely loved Assassin’s Creed II, but at some moments, I hated it. Without spoiling anything, Assassin’s Creed II takes place in the near future. Your character, Desmond, enters into the “Animus” (think Holodeck from Star Trek), where he gets to relive the memories of  a famed Italian assassin, Ezio Auditore.  The bulk of the game takes place across popular Italian cities in the 1400s. As Ezio Auditore you must avenge the death of your father and unveil the underlying Templar plot to limitless power through ancient religious relics Ubisoft Montreal definitely poured their hearts and souls into this project. The amount of detail in each area of Italy is unrivaled in any sandbox game. The experience feels very authentic as you hear some Italian and English with Italian accents throughout the entire game. The graphics are great and the amount of activity happening throughout the city is incredible and really brings the in-game world to life Aside from the main quest there are plenty of side missions and collectibles adding hours of game play to this title. As Ezio you can choose to take on freelance assassination contracts, courier assignments, races or help out troubled wives by beating the snot out of their cheating husbands. The controls are where the game feels most conflicting for me. At some points the controls feel perfect. Climbing and jumping from building to building across entire cities is very empowering, but every once in a while Ezio will not jump or climb to where you intended him to and it can be very frustrating. Especially when performing a timed race or mission. The combat at times can also feel a bit flaky and unresponsive. A few weeks before playing Assassin’s Creed 2 I had been playing Batman: Arkham Asylum and absolutely loved the combat system in that game. It has become my point of reference as to how 3rd person action games should control and Assassin’s Creed 2 just doesn’t compare.. Another peeve of mine is that in order to activate some missions you must go to a marker on your map. Once you get to that marker generally you are given an objective that takes place at another point on the map. If you mess up during the mission, you are forced to go back to where the mission was assigned to you. This sometimes forces you to travel across the city over and over which can be disheartening. I wish that Ubisoft would have you start over from where the mission actually starts and not where it is assigned from. It may sound like I have more complaints than compliments for this title but my feelings overall towards the game are extremely positive and I highly recommend it. If you are a fan of 3rd person action/adventure games like Legend of Zelda or Okami, you absolutely need to play this game. Without a doubt one of the top 5 games of 2009.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed 2 was one of my favorite games of ‘09. There’s more than enough game there, so DLC really isn’t necessary, but there were a couple ‘memory chapters’ in the game that went ‘corrupted’ if you get the ‘Animus’ lingo. Word around the campfire is that the devs couldn’t polish up these chapters in time for the game’s release, therefore, with the power of the internet, we can get them later. The 1st one just came out on Xbox Live and the PSN, it’s 4 bux for an hour of so of gameplay…not too bad. The Raw rating, 7/10. The Good – In case you couldn’t get enough AC2, here’s a little more. If you like the fight system, then there’s plenty of that to do here. One mission had me timed, I was able to pull it off with 3 seconds left on the clock…while it really shouldn’t have taken me that long, it was quite thrilling to pull it off in such fashion. A character that you’re briefly introduced to in the main game gets to be fleshed out here, and she’s an awesome character at that. The main game had only one flying mission, once you were done you couldn’t do it anymore, with Battle of Forli, you have the option to freefly from a spot anytime you want. Overall, pretty worth it if you’re a big AC2 fan. The Bad – Even if you are a big AC2 fan, you’re not missing alot by skipping this…as I said, it’s worth it, but…no mind blowing revelations or anything like that. Nothing particularly new to do….and just in case you’re not a fan of the fighting system, then you really want to stay away from this. It’s only like an hour long, and ends pretty abruptly, leaving us hanging till next month for the next chapter. Once you finish the missions, you can’t go back and play them again. The Ugly – Me, stumbling with the controls trying get my bearings….while I got pretty good at the game, I finished it what, a month and a half ago? I went back to the training grounds just get smooth at it again.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[                             Price – PS3 - $3.99 , Xbox 360: 320 ($4.00) Microsoft Points [DOWNLOAD HERE]  Ever since the announcement that there was DLC coming for Assassin's Creed 2 I've been skeptical  that it would add anything new or interesting to the game. AC2 had extra content bleeding from its pores, so the DLC really couldn't add to that, and unless it was related to the overarching story of the Assassin's Creed series I couldn't really care less. So with a careful, yet hopeful heart I entered the DLC with the thirst for something interesting to hook me back into this world. Unfortunately I found nothing of the sort, and worse the DLC made me downright angry in a few places.  Achievement whores rejoice!     So you know that cool, morbid-looking town of Forli that you wanted to explore, and that neat Caterina Sforza lady who had a pretty bloody history that you wanted to hang with? Well now there's an actual story for you to explore here instead of rushing past Forli just to get to Venice. If only it was any good. The DLC starts right after Ezio gets the Apple and decides to hide it in Forli, but unfortunately the city has been taken over and you are tasked with helping Caterina with taking back the city from the commanders of the invasion force, the Orsi brothers.     It sounds like a nice set-up, but unfortunately the entire chapter seems more like a poorly written fan-fic than an actual story that is anyway related to the complex story of AC2, and has a predictable cliff-hanger that leads into the next piece of DLC, it just adds nothing new or interesting to the main plot.  The new mission memories also have nothing interesting, and are down right terrible as you go from escort mission to escort mission fighting off huge waves of enemies over-and-over again. At least the DLC now adds the option to use da Vinci's Flying Machine so the people who missed the 'Fly Swatter' achievement/trophy don't have to run through the entire game again,    Now to give a little backstory, this DLC and the second piece of DLC are both the missing chapters from the main game and I was curious in why they removed these chapters from it, but now after playing through the first one I can safely say I know why. Battle for Forli suffers from not just poor mission design and some odd new glitches which manage to stick Ezio to walls, but also slowing down the exciting and incredible story of AC2 to a grinding halt of mediocrity.   The best part about the entire DLC is that Caterina at one point goes crazy and starts cussing out the invaders which is pretty hilarious, but the DLC ends at an obvious cliff-hanger that'll lead into the next piece of DLC that left a sour-taste in my mouth, I don't see any reason for anyone but the hardcore AC2 fanatics to buy it and finish this uninteresting story thread. Unless you were one of the few people who missed the 'Fly Swatter' achievement/trophy, or if you're  really just dieing to play some terrible escort missions.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ The prior Assassin's Creed was probably the most hyped up series debut  not named Little Big Planet. It sold extremely well and provided a  storyline ripe with easy retelling as the idea of a man whose family  consists of hired killers throughout history gives a game near infinite  numbers of sequels to churn through. The second game in most series  tends to be the best of the bunch and we'll see if Assassin's Creed  continues that tradition.The first AC was a beautiful, but  horribly flawed, title. It had a wealth of solid ideas and concept, but  some poor execution that seemed to be borne out of a total lack of  thinking by the developers. Every single mission you performed consisted  of either listening in to people or beating up people until you unlock  the ability to kill your target. That is when the game hit its apex,  though, as the thought process required to sneak into a room or area  full of people sworn to protect one person and then get out again is a  game concept that really can't be beaten. And few titles makes a  character feel as simultaneously vulnerable, but kick-ass, as Altair  was.Desmond, this time around, has strapped back into the Animus  and is now portraying a family member named Ezio, who was in Italy  during the Renaissance. Ironically, one of his best friends if Leonardo  Da Vinci (I am not sure why it was necessary to include an actual  historical figure when a totally fictitious one works equally as well,  but I'm not one to nitpick). Your father gives you evidence to try and  absolve him and others of a crime they've been accused of. You go to the  man your father tells you to --- and, in a move that shocks nobody who  has watched TV/watched a movie/read a book/played a game in the last 20  years, turns on you and kills your father.So your tale becomes a  tale of revenge.Ezio has a few more tricks up his sleeve than  Altair did. More weapons, more armor, and more abilities provide a lot  of ways to tackle objectives. There really is a ton of things you can do  in fights, and it is a good thing because you will fight a lot....unless  you choose not to. In another nice turn of events, the developers also  allow you to pay courtisans or locals to distract or fight with guards,  giving you easy passage to treasure. This allows you to have a bit more  control over whether you play a killer or somebody who is able to  outhink his opponents. Both ways work quite well, to be honest.The  scope of the game is as large as the last one, and you still have the  impressive ability to move around the environment that you had in the  prior game. This works great, except in the occasional jumping timing  based puzzles in which you struggle to complete a challenge because the  camera is looking at the wall instead of ahead. Annoying, to say the  least. But, they have ramped up the difference in objectives.  You normally have to do several different things to achieve objectives.  Sometimes, you have to trail people. Other times, you have to win  mini-games. You have to kill a deliveryman and take over his place. You  even get to pilot a flying machine and crash the party of one of your  objectives to take him out as well. You are not alone as you get several  allies who will assist you with manpower on occasion or, other times,  weapons and new skills. Another huge change is your ability to  upgrade your home base. After you leave your home city, your uncle Mario  (yes, a Mario reference in a game about assassins seems a bit  incongruous) takes you into the old family homestead and you can choose  to upgrade the city to provide you additional revenue for weapons,  armor, and the like.The story seems a bit haphazard (there is a  bit where you return to present day to show you still have Ezio's  abilities in a segment that makes no sense whatsoever) and two DNA  sequences just don't exist (likely they will be DLC in the future). But,  the game does get going nicely and gives you a wealth of things to do  if you choose to (hint: get the codex pages during your travels. They  are required to end the game later).This is a good game and a  major improvement and I wonder how much more they can improve this  concept. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  Imagine a hidden-blade wielding assassin chasing his target at full  speed on top of a roof in Renaissance Italy.  Now imagine he leaps from  one building to another, over a canal in Venice. Then, he grabs a pole,  swings off that pole, and is now gracefully falling through the air.   Now imagine as he lands, he skillfully thrusts his blade through the  neck of his target. Now imagine this scenario is typical gameplay in a  game with beautiful graphics, tight and easy to grasp controls, a  driving story, and a setting bursting with atmosphere and detail. What  you’re picturing right now is exactly what Assassin’s Creed II has to  offer.   The sequel to 2007’s Assassin’s Creed, Assassin’s Creed II was released  on November 17, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 from our friends  at Ubisoft Montreal. It takes place during the Renaissance in  everyone’s favorite country shaped like a boot (more specifically, the  cities of Florence, San Gimignano, and Venice, among others).  The first  question anyone is going to ask is “So, like, is it just like AC but in  a different setting?” The only simple way to answer this is “In all the  best ways”.  You play as Ezio Auditore Di Firenze, another one of  Desmond Miles’ ancestors. He begins the story as a local son of a banker  who plans on following in his father’s footsteps. Except that before he  can reach his goal of counting money for a living, something terrible  happens. This sets him on a personal quest for vengeance, prompting him  to don a white cloak and hidden dagger. He was never part of a guild  before, but that isn’t an issue as the game is able to justify how he  learns to become an assassin. The story is fairly detailed, well  written, and sure to interest even the most historically cold hearted  high school student.   All of the best aspects of the first game are present and accounted for.  You’ve got your free-running on rooftops, your climbing seemingly  un-climbable buildings, your hidden blade (two, in fact!), and your  sneaking around trying to stab a fool without anyone knowing you were  even there. This game also adds a weapon and armor upgrade system,  currency, a small real-estate portion, and Leonardo Da Vinci: a family  friend who is eager to let you test out his inventions on several  unsuspecting guards. Of course it’s all in the name of science, so  there’s no need to feel bad about that. The game also manages to tie in  multiple other historical figures in interesting and innovative ways.   The combat here is built upon that of the last game, and the controls  are just as you’d expect them. You attack, grab, block, dodge, and  counter all with a combination of a trigger and the four face buttons.  It is easy to learn, difficult to master, though consistently rewarding.  You can pick up the discarded weapons of enemies (which range from  other swords to battle axes and spears) to really “stick” it to ‘em.    ACII is a sequel in the best sense of the word. Not only does it feature  all of the good stuff listed above, but it also does away with all the  elements that made the first game not so great. There is now a much  larger variety of side quests to perform when you’re not busy  assassinating someone. These are not only more fun, but aren’t required  to progress through the story. So if, for some reason, you have a thing  against beating up dudes, taking on extra assassination contracts,  running races, or delivering high-priority mail, you can definitely skip  these activities without penalty. However, if you enjoy doing stuff  like that, there’s plenty of opportunity to be found here. These side  missions also act as a great way to learn the layout of the city that  you’re currently in. There’s only about five or six different types, but  each one is named individually, so at least you get the impression that  you’re doing something unique each time.  If repetition is really a pain in your behind, then going through the  story will not require any painkillers on your part.  The missions vary  from getting from point A to point B, to taking out certain groups of  guards across the city, to certain cinematic events that are  one-of-a-kind, and give you quite the adrenaline rush upon completing.  The story here is noticeably longer than that of the first game, and  will likely take you anywhere from fifteen to twenty hours to complete,  depending of the side missions you partake in. It should also be noted  that it is very easy to get distracted from the main story with all  there is to do and see.   But in order to see as much as you can, you’ll once again need to scale  and sync viewpoints, which requires that you climb to the spot  indicated. There are 62 of these spots in the entire game. It gets  tiresome and plain old boring scaling towers for the sake of scaling  towers, and since some of them are repeats (you’ll scale the same tower  about four different times, difference being the location), partaking in  other side missions will sound like a preferable alternative,  especially because the whole “viewpoint” thing goes on longer than it  should.     Certain missions that involve “tailing” someone also have a tendency  to go on longer than they should.  Checkpoints are generally spread  pretty thin during these missions, so patience is definitely a virtue  for making it through incognito, and with both Ezio (and your  controller) in one piece.    From a technical viewpoint, this game looks and sounds beautiful.  Everything from the busy city streets to the slight wave of Ezio’s cape  looks smooth and sharp. The sound design is also a strong point. Busy  market noises, peaceful relaxed chatter, the violent clash of swords,  and the scream of a slain foe all sounds very well done. The  orchestrated music composed by Jesper Kyd fits the mood perfectly. Add  all of that to beautiful looking textures and effects, with highly  detailed environments, and Assassin’s Creed II presents you with what  feels like a living, breathing world where you will want to spend as  much time in as you can.   When making a sequel, you always need to balance out new content while  maintaining what made the first game what it was. Assassin’s Creed 2  does a marvelous job of that. It is still definitely Assassin’s Creed,  but with refinements, adjustments, and additions that improve on every  part of the first game. The controls are familiar but improved, the  story is deeper and more fleshed out, and the environments are as pretty  and feel as alive as they’ll ever be. There is a lot more to do, and  side missions are a lot more interesting this time around, but certain  of the other parts of the game can begin to feel tedious. This is  overshadowed, though, by the terrific main story and strong narrative.  Truly a sequel in the best sense of the word, ACII is definitely worth  playing if you liked anything about Assassin’s Creed. ]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[In 2007 Ubisoft Montreal released the original Assassin's Creed to critical 'meh'-ing; it wasn't a bad or broken game as such, but it didn't live up to people's expectations and instead became a somewhat boring game experience. The missions were tedious, the fighting was average and apparently you were wearing horns and carrying a devil's fork since everyone was instantly suspicious of you. But you could go monotonously climb to the top of buildings and forcibly stare at the pretty view so it was all ok right? Right?   In the end Ubisoft was sent away with its tail between its legs only to reappear with the sequel, triumphantly declaring ""We fixed it!"". And to their credit, they have. Assassin's Creed 2 moves the setting to Italy and the time frame to late 15th century (Apparently when teleporting to locations was invented). The missions are varied enough to keep you interested, the combat has vastly improved and you can actually run without having a crowd of angry guards chasing after you. Huzzah! The problem is, this is what the original Assassin's Creed should have been.  There's no denying I had fun playing this game. And in the end, that's what determines how good a game is. If I'm not enjoying the experience, or gripped by what's going on, then in my mind the game has failed. My problem purely comes down to the fact the changes are pretty 'tick box'. It's as if the team sat down, read the reviews to the first game and created a list of the bad things. And now they roll out the changes, one by one, in order to shut up those critics. In some ways, this is what a sequel should do; learn from it's mistakes and make sure they don't crop up again. But look at any other media and they wouldn't be allowed to get away with it. A book writer can't publish a book to average reviews before rewriting a few sentences and re-releasing it a couple of years later.  So perhaps I should ignore what's come before. See this as an original game with enjoyable gameplay. The level design is beautiful. Places like Venice and Tuscany are truly stunning, and make you wonder why no one previously has taken advantages of such amazing locales. The story moves along nicely and at least this time gives you grounding to go along and throw people off buildings. And the music intergrates with both the tone and setting perfectly without making it seem like you're watching an educational reconstruction. The game controls well, with a simple enough button layout, but the day I can climb up to the top of my house that easily will be a good day for us all i.e. traversing the environment is a little too easy unless you're a fiftteenth century spider-man. AC2 also introduces side quests which are pure Prince of Persia grade traversal. These take place in several 'closed off' environments in order to gain the armor of Altair from the previous game, who apparently ran around in kevlar in his later years.  The notoriety system is a great introduction to the game, where in doing bad things gets you noticed. Funny that. At the heart of it it's a great idea to solve the previous game's problem, although since the majority or the time you'll stay unnoticed it tends to boil down to you swiping down the odd wanted poster when you make an error. The combat is very varied, both in the choice of weapons and  your options for what to do with them. Getting rid of enemies isn't too difficult, though the having the choice to do so is admirable. Being able to pull enemies off buildings or into haysacks never gets old. The variety of weapons both comes from those dropped by enemies and those available at stores bought with your hard earned/stolen flore....floren....flo.....money. Which you will do a lot since the life of an assassin is apparently  a lucrative one. By the end of the game you'll be swimming in the stuff, which makes the pickpocketing and robbing technique introduced early on seem quite pointless. The majority of your cash comes from your villa back home. Apparently not only are you great with a sword but also very business savvy, ultimately allowing you to plow your cash into buildings and shops in return for discounts and cumulative profits. I do however wish something more had been done with this, since after you've 'bought everything out' there's little sense of accomplishment. And so Assassin's Creed 2 has a lot going for it. It's a great game that I'd happily recommend to anyone. But part of me wants to punish Ubisoft for simply doing what they should've done in the first place. You can't fault them for improving the game to a playable state, but when you compare it to the changes from games such as Mass Effect to its' respective sequel these seem purely superficial and to an extent forced- if Ubisoft hadn't had any feedback on their first game would they have simply pushed out an identical sequel? I'm interested to see the direction they take with AC3. Perhaps this time you won't exist in a land where apparently half the population were bitten by radioactive spiders.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ This is a review for  Assassin's Creed 2 that I wrote, it never got posted on any website, so  I bring it here for you guys. I know it's been months since it's  release, but why not. This was written before the announcement of the  two packs of DLC. Tired of all the  sequals this year? Well, here's another one! Assassin's Creed 2  continues at the exact moment of the firsts ending, but is it changed  enough to warrent a sequal? Or will fanboys cry that it should have been  downloadable and boycott it? Well, sufice to say Ubisoft did a great  job with this game. They listened to fans complaints and compliments and  adjusted accordingly. Is it worth your money?Let me start out  by saying this is a grogeous game on any platform you play it on. Just  climbing to the top of a tower and looking at the city below you is  breath taking. The attention to detail is amazing. Some people may  critisize the cutscenes for some strange detail problems and animation  issues, but even that doesn't impact how great this game looks,  especially since slow down issues are a rare occurance. It's definatly a  beautiful tour of Italy. I personally don't see that there are any of  these issues. Sure, some of the lip syncing might be a bit off and odd  looking, but everything is finely detailed. Just the sheer look of  Ezio's armor is glorious! Much more interesting than Altairs, which you  can even unlock. The animations are very realistic and well done. Every  move Ezio makes through the city looks real and fits very well, even  when you're charging through the streets and falling over pedestrians. Speaking  of unlockables, there are a ton of stuff to collect and even a town to  manage in Assassin's Creed 2. Early on in the game you are given the  option to use some money to renovate the Villa, and by doing so you gain  bonuses. Upgrading the shops give you discounts, and the more you  upgrade, the more income you recieve. It was a nice addition, although  seems a bit pointless in the end. The money you gain is way too much and  you end up being able to buy every new piece of armor or weapon as soon  as they are available. It makes some sense with Ezio's character, but  it could have been implemented a little better. There are also new  missions to undertake. Side missions include races, assassination  contracts, beating up cheating husbands, exploring tombs and of course  there are plenty of Viewpoints to find. Collectables have thankfully  been overhauled. Gone are the hundreds of flags in each town to collect,  instead being replaced by Feathers, Statues, even some 30 odd Paintings  and things like the weapons and armor. All are displayed or kept in the  villa. This means it's less of mindless romp looking for those stupid  flags. The combat would be best described as more refined, but  very similar. There have been a lot of moves added but it works in much  the same way as the previous game. There's still those counter moves  that make you cringe, and just the fact that they added more weapons  means some of them are even worse. One of the moves added that will most  likely be used a hell of a lot, since it's the most useful, is  disarming opponents. The combat is not without its faults. Sometimes  disarms and counters just don't happen, but this doesn't happen often.  The free-running aspect is still the same, which unfortunatly means the  frustratingly strange jumps still happen if you aren't extra careful. It  can be a pain, but it's nothing game breaking.Throughout the  game the story throws many twists and turns at you, and it flows very  smoothly, even though there is a gap of about 20 years or so nearing the  end of the game. Even that doesn't break the pacing and it was  definatly a focus point of the developers. This is what most sequals  should be. They removed what gamers felt were wrong with the first game,  and even added more things to improve the time you spend with this  game, and you will spend a lot of time playing this game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[To be blunt with this. It is an amazing game. It is Just as free-roam as the first, allowing you to travel anywhere within the game boundary that you have unlocked. The fighting is much more interesting, different guards will use different battle tactics to try and kill you. Ezio's  abilities far exceed that of altair,  Ezio can climb faster, Blend much more easily, can disarm enemies, and can even swim (unlike altair who, if placed in above knee high water somehow drowns). There is much more weaponry to choose from, Including Axes, Knives, Hammers, a claymore, swords, and even a gun, leaving multiple ways open of how you want to kill your enemy.  Adding the element of water travel opens up many more methods of reaching your target as well, instead of a heads on assault you could easily swim around and flank your target, Leaving your health meter intact. The addition of a second hidden blade allows for double assassinations, helping you clear out your targets two at a time rather than just picking them off one by one. And lastly The storyline, although the ending is kinda insulting to the religious, other than that, it's good. I would highly recommend getting this game if you haven't already.]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  Ubisoft fires up the Animus once again in Assassin’s Creed II this time dropping players into to Renaissance Italy. ACII promises to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor while smoothing out its many rough edges. Does this tale of parallel narratives manage to climb to new heights or does it trip over its own ambitions? Assassin’s Creed II tells the tale of two characters: Desmond Miles, an uninteresting man who is the direct descendant of a long line of assassin’s who have been at war with a group known as the Templars for centuries. Immediately the game recaps the events of Assassin’s Creed which is a lot to take in for those who never played the first game. Desmond’s side of the story is fairly dull but Ubisoft wisely makes his trip to the Animus 2.0 (a device that allows him to re-live memories of ancestors) short and keeps him out of the way for the majority of the game. This time Desmond recounts the life of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a womanizing young man who loves getting into fist fights, and climbing to the highest points of late 15 Century Italy. Ezio’s fun is quickly cut short when his father and brothers are arrested and publicly executed. Before their execution Ezio is instructed to retrieve the tools of the assassin’s trade from his father’s office. This event bluntly forces him into the life and struggle of the assassin’s. Revenge is his number one priority as he seeks training in the art of the kill. Once Ezio assassinates those responsible for the loss of half of his family and settles into the life of a killer, the story becomes fairly uninteresting as his personal stake in the plot grows slim. Player’s will run into a large cast of interesting characters (including Leonardo Da Vinci and Rodrigo Borgia) but they’ll merely send Ezio on errands and hits. There is a lot of 15 century political jargon and information on the landmarks and people of the time but most players will only want to know who to follow, escort, or kill to keep the plot moving forward. The story drags on far longer than it needs to and finishes with a devastatingly easy final battle and an ending that will disappoint players who don’t care for the sci-fi side of things. Assassin’s Creed II’s open world features a large number of mission types and even more ways to complete them. Ezio’s parkour skills are just as strong as Altair’s. Running across the rooftops of Venice is as fun as it is simple. You merely hold down two buttons and watch as Ezio scurries up the sides of buildings, leaps from roof to roof, and drops like a graceful stone from astonishing heights. Players can usually depend on Ezio to go where they want him to but specific segments in the game that require very precise platforming can become frustrating. Sometimes players just won’t know why Ezio narrowly misses a platform or can’t find a hand hold on the side of a building.  Combat offers players a fair amount of options in the form of swords, smoke bombs, daggers, two hidden wrist blades, and (surprisingly) a pistol. Ezio can also taunt, dodge, grab, throw, and block enemy attacks. The combat system is deep but players will end up merely holding down the block button and spamming counter kills due to the enemy’s predictable attack patterns and ditzy AI. Getting in a fight isn’t always an option however and this is when Ezio’s ability to blend into a crowd takes center stage. Often times the game will task you with an assassination that requires you to remain undetected. Ezio can avoid being recognized by sitting on a bench, standing within a group of NPCs, diving into a stack of hay, or merely staying out of enemy’s line of sight. The game’s execution of blending is far fetched, pushing the player’s suspension of disbelief as Ezio’s pursuers are quick to dismiss him if he so much as turns a corner before sitting down on a bench. A man dressed like Ezio, covered in throwing knives and swords, blending into a crowd of hookers is harder to believe than the idea of Adam and Eve escaping from a futuristic Eden. Assassin’s Creed II’s visual presentation is nothing short of breathtaking. Every building and structure is rendered with an incredible amount of detail and depth. Hunting down viewpoints scattered across the world rewards the player with a sweeping camera move that shows the city in all of its glory from eagle eye heights. The streets are densely populated with people constantly interacting with each other and reacting to the player’s every move. Ezio’s animations running from spot to spot and in combat are fluid and visceral. Counter kills may not be the most fun to perform over and over but watching them never gets old. Character models don’t have the same amount of detail as the city but their faces are extremely well animated and expressive. Voice acting is rock solid as every character in the game is fully voiced in English and Italian. Minstrels will serenade Ezio for money, ladies will casually flirt with him, and any corpses left out in the open will cause a panic in the area. Again… the presentation is easily the most impressive aspect of this game and makes Ezio’s world truly feel alive. Assassin’s Creed II manages to address many of the faults and failures of the first game to deliver a much more fluid and straight forward experience. The world of Renaissance Italy has never felt more alive and traversing your way around its terrain is as fun as ever. Enemy AI removes the fun and depth from the combat but the presentation gives players something to enjoy within these dull encounters. The parallel narratives clash at times and the sci-fi finale is disappointing but players will definitely be eager to see where the series goes from here. Assassin’s Creed was a very ambitious title that had a lot of great ideas but their flawed execution kept it from becoming an instant hit. But no matter how you felt about the first game, make sure you get your hands on Assassin’s Creed II.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[For those that didn't play the first Assassin's Creed, here's a summary of what you did in the game: running, riding horse, sneaking into city, beating people up, EAGLE DIVE, racing, 'ooooh, flag!', assassination, running home. Rinse and repeat some nine times, and finish with the most Epically Subtle Genre Shift I've ever come across.Looking back on the first game, it's clear to see that Assassin's Creed II has...not actually come all that far. When you get to the second major city, you quickly realise you'll still be doing the same thing time and time again (and also come to the realisation that all of the 'Beat Up' missions are women being cheated on...hmm...). However. Where the second game does improve is that it's not as obvious as it was. In fact with the arse-kicking new moves you have at your disposal and the variety of weapons you can accrue it's almost one of the joys of the game, providing nice diversions from the main plot. Speaking of which, the plot is superbly executed and well-written. A nice blend of vague humour and macabre undertones hinting at something more sinister going on, the (richly accented) dialogue seems to pull you in and drag the story out only so far as it needs to be. Downside? There's two plots running in tandem, much as the first game, and occasionally the overlapping can cause some jarring clashes (such as the ending of Ezios main plot).Generally the game allows you to put the abilities at your disposal to good use, albeit in whatever way the game programmers saw fit. Some missions you're required to stay hidden, some you have no choice but to be exposed. And this is, perhaps, the games only major flaw: for a game called Assassin's Creed that actively encourages you to remain hidden as much as possible, it's also a game that often pushes you into exposing yourself. This flaw also ties into the 'Roof Archers Won't Let Me On The Roof, But They Let Theives Loiter Up There?' and the 'Guards Also Took A Level In Freerunning?' flaw. But after a while it all just becomes another part of the game, and you'll probably stop noticing it. Until, that is, you find yourself being chased across the roofs by 14 guards. Then you'll find it annoying again. The game is, overall, a very enjoyable game. The character development is positively astounding, the vistas are pretty, combining flowing climbing and jumping to traverse a city is amazing, and it never fails to feel good when you do manage to complete a mission by being sneaky. The end mission leaves much to be desired, with another Epically Subtle Genre Shift (except this time, not-so-subtle in many ways), but seeing as the rest of the game has been such a joy it almost feels like I should have expected it...]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[It's a good little DLC if: A) You missed the Flying Machine Achievement B) You are invested in the plot C) You enjoy keeping people alive who don't know how to stay out of trouble It just so happens that reasons A and B were my reasons of choice. They weren't enough to make it enjoyable, but enough for me to be content to sit and play it. 'Battle of Forli' sees you spending most of your time protecting two people. Which is fine until they part ways, go running off into danger, and after all that expect you to go and save people where you find the frustrating AI is frustrating all over again. 'Fun'? No. 'Worth the money'? Perhaps. 'Downright annoying'? Yes.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The premise for 'Bonfire of the Vanities' is pretty simple, and one you'll be familiar with by now. The gameplay is also simple: it's pretty much just a string of assassinations. There are a few new additions, such as spring poles and if you buy the more expensive version three new Templar Hideouts. Personally I didn't understand the spring-pole-jump-long-way-thing. Or at least how to use it: they were quite picky on positioning, and when you're running to try and avoid archers it can be a little difficult to get it right. But they aren't essential to gameplay, which really feels like a way to stretch your assassination skills out of hibernation. Overall, it's pleasantly short, and a nice way to fill in the final gap of the story.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed II is the John Wilkes Booth of assassin video games. Sure you've murdered your target, but you've also clumsily leapt off a banister (possibly cracking your leg in two) and you have half the goddamn country chasing you from Ford's Theatre. At its simple core, that is Assassin's Creed II's gameplay. To an onlooker, your actions make you look like a stumbling, blundering idiot. Is that what you signed up for when you decided to play a game called Assassin's Creed? Probably not, but that is the depth of gameplay experience that you'll take out of the franchises' latest iteration.  Sure, you'll visit an ambitiously recreated Italy, never seen in such splendor within a video game's context before.  But the story counteracts this design ambition.  Its writers force a story that is ultimately insulting to not only the player but in how it treats its protagonist, Ezio Auditore.  Why couldn't the story just take place in the world that was created? The one where I run and jump and exist?  While Assassin's Creed II is not a broken product by any means it is this culmination of narrative idiocy and dissatisfying gameplay that make it a coward in big budget gaming.  A stealthy approach? Nope I just fell in the canal while getting chased across the rooftops like an  idiot.     As the protagonist you are assigned numerous targets that must be assassinated. By definition this means the target would preferably be murdered by guile, stealth, or subterfuge. That is because in order for your line of work to be defined as assassin you must live to slay another day. In Assassin's Creed II you are only given the gameplay tools to be the most awkward of so-called assassins. You have no way to approach your target in stealth. You have no means to escape without being chased like a simple cutpurse. There is no way for you to plan your assassination! Booth at least had a getaway horse stashed away. While you play Assassin's Creed II, every one of your assassinations will play out like this: You scale the wall of the target's hiding place, you dash past the target's sentries (possibly slaying a few), and you run directly up to your target and engage in melee or maybe you'll get lucky and the game will allow you to perform an instant kill. While you fight your target to the death their guards have gathered around you like a bunch of thugs from Romeo Must Die. In order to complete your mission you must escape: so you either a) run away from the orgy you've assembled or b) just kill them all (without a firehose).  ACII never really gains any depth beyond ""concept art  in motion"".     Which takes us to the other main area of gameplay: the combat. So you killed Count Douchebag and his bodyguard squadron has surrounded you. Even a novice player could kill more than ten men, easily. This is because more than one guard will rarely ever gang up on you and because you can counter nearly every attack. Counters are the crux of the sword play in Assassin's Creed II. When you counter an opponent's attack, you pay witness to a spectacular animation as you stab them in the throat, force their own rapier into their gut, or simply snatch their own blade from their hands and dice them to bits. But playing a game where the only way to kill your opponents is by countering their attacks is every bit as satisfying as beating a goon to death with a bulletproof jacket. The only times you actually land a strike on someone is if you walk up from behind an enemy and stick them with your hidden blades. That just sucks.I have personally spent several months in Italy and have visited every city featured within the game or one of equal size and prestige. This game has create a facsimile of true life architecture that is unparalleled. Walking through the Piazza San Marco in Venice is breathtaking and inspiring. Climbing to the top of the duomo in Florence is simply stupefying. As you carouse the streets of Italy's Renaissance you realize that this is the home of Michaelangelo,         Leonardo, the shit that romantic history is made of. But for all of the loving craftmanship that has gone into creating this world, it is squandered by being featured in an utterly dumb game. Its streets bustle with life and activity, but why the hell are you running along the rooftops? Because it looks cool, dude! Imagine if this world was implemented into a game that needed its lifelike appearances, such as an  Elder Scrolls game. What does it matter if there are doctors, whores, and festivals lining the streets if you are going to spend the majority of your time traipsing around red-tiled rooftops?  A compelling lead character that is undermined by the overarching story.     Gameplay aside, Assassin's Creed II's true travesty is its storyline. The artists have constructed a realistic world in the same way Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven is realized. Utterly, historically real. The writers have created a great new protagonist role for you to fill,        Ezio Auditore. He is a crafty, womanizing bastard with just enough smart ass in him that you like the son of a bitch. His tale is a simple one of revenge but goddamned if I don't think he's a great lead character. He walks the line between street ruffian and a slumming aristocrat with a backstory reminiscent of that classic Shakespearean feud between the Montagues and Capulets. However, you are periodically pulled from Ezio's story into a parallel storyline about       Desmond Miles. Desmond is a worthless distraction. He has literally no backstory, no character, nothing worth mentioning except his crooked nose and that he's voiced by   Nolan North. The fact that Desmond's story is the backbone of the Assassin's Creed franchise shows that the game's creators are utter cowards. Both ACI and ACII feature beautiful and breathtaking worlds that have never been featured in video games to such awe-inspiring detail before. The games are rife with historical data and show that its designers have spent plenty of time pouring over history books. But instead of simply featuring stories that only take place in the world's they have created they doubted themselves and created a bullshit Matrix rip-off with a      Da Vinci Code flair. It is so dissatisfying to see Ezio's story stolen from him. By doing this, the story is telling you that all of your actions in the game are utterly for naught. What you've been doing has been pointless. Well,  Assassin's Creed II, thanks for nothing! I feel bad for poor Ezio.  The designers did not think gamers would be interested in a story that took place exclusively in Renaissance Italy.  So you get this douche-bag as a distraction.     The icing on the cake is that the final battle of the game is so utterly dumb that once I finished it I felt embarrassed to be a gamer. Without spoiling this final battle I will create a suitable parallel. Let's say in Assassin's Creed 7 you play the role of a Civil War assassin, killing numerous Union Generals and Aristocrats. As you work your way up to the final chapter of the game you engage in your last encounter, a fist fight with     Abe Lincoln himself! But Assassin's Creed II's finale is even worse. It is so, so dumb. Totally dumb. Man, it sucks to be Ezio. He needs a new agent.I played Assassin's Creed II to 100% completion in under 17 hours. The fact that I completed the game says something to its inherent quality as an entertainment product. While the story is worthless in an artistic sense, its events compel you forward as a gamer. The scenes with Leonardo and his glider are quite fun and I really enjoyed the wagon chase half-way through the game. Ezio could've used many more diversions such as these but I guess rowing along in a gondola will have to do. While I think the verticality of the game is misplaced, climbing and swinging was incredibly fun for me within the Assassin's Tomb sections. These sections have you scaling around the inside of catacombs and basilicas in order to reach a hidden section where a famous assassin was entombed. It made me want some more scripted climbing sequences to be included in some of Ezio's assassinations.  Unlike John Wilkes Booth, Ezio might not have been shot while trying to escape a burning barn but even worse his existence was pretty much nullified within the context of the game's story. While it might be worth a weekend rental, I suggest you too forget Assassin's Creed II because damn, even a do-gooder like    Batman makes for a better killer.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Play it NOW!: Assassins Creed 2  A period piece, fictional or not, has always been something I have an affinity towards. Maybe it is the academic in me, but understanding events in world history can bring about a more comprehensive relationship between past, present and future. So goes the plot for Assassins Creed 2 or at least my interpretation of Desmond’s story arch. But unlike the first one, AC2 lets you spend most of your days inside the DNA of Desmond, living out his ancestor’s story. That story is of one Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and it is one of the many accomplishments of AC2 over its predecessor. On a more personal note, I was a big supporter of the first title, despite its short comings. The ability of Ubisoft Montreal to capture the atmosphere  of the crusades     was more than enough to get me on board, but the overwhelming satisfaction of taking a 20 foot drop off the edge of a building and impaling the skull of your target, is why I stayed until the end. It really is quite gratifying after a long day at work, regardless of impressions that I may be a sociopath. Happily, that feeling returns in AC2, with twice as many hidden blades, plus some additional assassination techniques. This variety beautifully applies to almost all the aspects of the game, eliminating the previous complaints some had about the repetition and monotony of the mission structure. Instead of the assassinations happening in a vacuum, many assassinations are paced differently from each other and required fewer side quests to get the mission started. There is also a personal motivation behind the assassinations and without spoilers; Ezio is way more pissed off at these people than Altair was in the original. The dialogue does alot to reinforce this obviously, but the choice of using ""Ital-ish"" dialoge had me turning on the subtitles so I could get a translation. Not bad for building the atmosphere, but it begs the question of why the full italian dialogue is not as good as the ""Ital-ish""?  With more comparisons to the original, lets look to life outside the assassination racket. Certainly Altair had some personality besides that of a cold blooded killer, but we never saw it. With Ezio, you find out in the first few hours (yeah, it is tedious) that he is the typical Italian alpha male in his prime; climbing cathedrals, beating up punks from rival families, and wooing merchant’s daughters. There is character introduction, plot development and even a sick burn from the mouth of Ezio’s mother, before all hell breaks loose and you don the assassin’s robes. After some redemption, Ezio discovers there is an uncle who lives outside of Florence and he agrees to take you in, but does make a request to spruce up the Auditore Estate and the village that surrounds it.    Now, on your days off from assassinating the Templers of Italy, you can actually engage in a meta-game, which involves you developing the economy of the town through monetary investments, in order to attract tourism and gain a substantial return. So much of a return, that by game end you will have more money than there is stuff to buy. But what kind of stuff can you buy one might ask? There is of course investing in the town directly, improving shops, guilds, a bank and various amenities but also art plays a huge part and the more art you collect from each city, the more valuable your estate is. Armor and Weapons also become art, with each piece you unequipped going on display at your estate. Combined that with the collecting challenges like roman statues, codex pages, feathers, assassin seals, etc and the entire process of managing this town becomes a game all unto itself, and is a nice break from the wash/rinse/repeat of assassinations. The blending is also an improvement over Altairs ability, allowing Ezio to blend with any group of people number 3 or more. Also, Ezio can hire prostitutes, mercenaries or thieves to walk along with him to blend or to go distract guards while Ezio searches for treasure. There are other small touches too, like catching thieves or messengers and taking their Florins, and hiding your opponents in haystacks after their grissly demise. All of these things were vital in really fleshing out the open world elements. It is a beautiful excursion through Renaissance Italy with plenty to do and very little to complain about in my opinion. So if your a fan of Assassins, Treasures and ""Ita-lish"" dialogue. Play it NOW!  *Completed story on PS3, played each type of side quest at least once and earned a Platinum trophy **All images are a result of Google image search     Republished from www.twocanplayblog.com ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[In Assassin's Creed II, players will once again delve into the memory of Desmond Miles, AC1's main but not-so-main character. You will play as the genetic memory of Ezio Auditore Da Firenze, a noble from Florence during Italy's Renaissance period. Ezio is a much more likable character than Altair, he has personality, a decent background and a good sense of humor. I liked him from the beginning, unlike AC1 where my first thought of Altair was ""Man, this guy's a dick"", even after he redeemed himself.The first thing you will notice about Assassin's Creed II is the improved lighting and sharper textures. If you're new to the Assassin's Creed universe then my first instinct would be to point you to the latest Assassin's Creed game available and that would be Assassin's Creed II. However, Assassin's Creed II picks up just SECONDS after AC1 finishes so I would highly recommend you finishing AC1 before touching AC2.Playing a game set in the Renaissance period is a first for me and may be also for other players, however it worked very well and its always fun to laugh at their funny hats. Some players may half expect that the game to be little too steampunk after seeing the pistol and the flying machine on the trailers, I felt this way also, but my expectation was completely overthrown as the flying machine minigame happens only once (twice with DLC) and Ezio takes a few seconds to take aim with the pistol. Being able to only fire one shot at a time and the pistol being incredibly loud, makes this weapon a total last resort and is realistic in the sense that Ezio is the first person to use this prototype technology.The combat has been drastically improved. With several new types of weapons included in the game, many players will get enjoyment out of experimenting with the fighting system (I know I did) and the time space to counter attack has been increased. One of the new main features of this system is the ability to disarm an enemy and use their own weapon against them. I truly felt like a professional going into combat and not equipping any of my weapons, just using my bare hands to disarm guards and strike them down. Also proper counter attacking and normal striking with the hidden blades has been properly integrated into this system, unlike in AC1 where you could only counter attack with them. The blades are fast and powerful to most guards, however not as effective to some of the new guard types, Brutes in particular.Many players will also be happy at the ability to customise your character, being able to dye Ezio's clothing with different colour pallets depending on the city you're in creates much more immersion and realism, as a real Assassin would blend in with the crowd without standing out too much, which AC1 failed to do (I mean seriously, a Scholar with swords and knives covering him?). Being able upgrade your OWN TOWN with different shops and upgrading your Villa with different paintings creates a great task to be sidetracked in. Upgrading your town and Villa also generates income for you, which is one of the main ways to make money in the game, also some weapons can only be bought from the vendors in your town.There are collectables, but only one type, and they're spread throughout the five cities so there's no city-specific flags to worry about. These collectables are small and are spaced through the very large cities, a guide may be necessary to find them all. Another thing that most players will be very thankful for is the ability to swim, it makes escaping from tight situations much, much easier and it is fun great fun swan diving off the tallest tower in Venice and plummeting into the water.Aside from there being so much more stuff to do, this game doesn't come without its share of bugs and frustrations. Firstly, the free running has been improved a huge amount, making it faster and smoother, but it still suffers from the ""jumping-in-the-opposite-direction-when-I-wanted-to-go-that-way"" bug or directional mapping on the controller, whatever you want to call it, it gets f*cking annoying when doing races. I also suffered being clipped and stuck into a wall from guards throwing rocks at me while I was climbing, causing me to have to exit the game and reload. The lip syncing on the characters though is laughable, watching their inflated mouths move up and down is quite entertaining but can sometimes stop you from taking the game seriously.You will spend a small portion of the game playing as Desmond. However his gameplay instances are few and far between. Although you do get to utilise free running abilities as Desmond on an obstacle course in a hangar. The game has Desmond much more involved both as a more playable character and as a protagonist. Players should expect to see more of him in Assassin's Creed III.After finishing AC1 several times I can safely say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if it was extremely tedious and repetitive. Assassin's Creed II builds and improves on the story and gameplay of the original, even if it does retain some of the bugs, although they are less dramatic. I spent a solid week on this game, doing everything there is to do and there was never a moment where I felt any sort of boredom. In fact, I probably wouldn't have gone upstairs to eat if didn't know there was left over Christmas pudding. After finishing Assassin's Creed II, all I can say is that it is simply a better game. Ubisoft have done a brilliant job in making Assassin's Creed II much smoother and more enjoyable experience than its predecessor and improving the story and character development.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[                   Assassin's Creed 2 is a large improvement to its  eponymous predecessor in that it removed the need to do a minimum of  side quests to continue to the main assassination missions and you can  now SWIM!!! The side missions are still there and collection of items  has expanded and instead of flags to collect there is feathers that have  significance to some characters in game. Other then that the in-game  mechanics are basically the same with the addition of more tools and  weapons e.g. the double hidden blades. I appreciate the vibrancy of  Renaissance Italy of Assassin's Creed 2 more then the Crusades era  Western Asian Syria of the previous game.                 The story and fiction of the Assassins vs. Templars  world has swelled from Assassin's Creed 1. The story starts off directly  where the last one left us with Desmond, a prisoner at Abstergo, an  pharmacy conglomerate which is a cover for their Templar roots, who just  got done with exploring the genetic memories of his ancestor Altair in  the Animus, a machine that allows the user to venture into the mind and  memories of their ancestors, and is now breaking out of the Abstergo lab  with the former Abstergo employee Lucy who you find out is actually  working with the Assassins. The reason for going into the Animus is to  find clues and information to the whereabouts of the Pieces of Eden  gathered from the memories of Desmond's assassin ancestors. The whole  Assassins against Templars dispute revolves around the powerful and  mysterious Pieces of Eden introduced at the end of the first game that  have the power to manipulate those under its control do whatever the  wielder desires. The Templars have been using them to control people and  to gain power and the Assassins want to stop them.                 The new avatar for Desmond and the player to run  around as is Ezio Auditore di Firenze from the noble Auditore family  from Florence. The back drop for the story is during the Pazzi rebellion  against the then banker-ruler Lorenzo de Medici from the powerful and  influential de Medici banking family of Florence. The game introduces  and uses the setting of warring city-states of Renaissance Italy well  while also introducing historical bits into their fictitious yarn. In  fact there are many in-game opportunities to learn and explore this  world so when you run into a historical building e.g. Santa Maria  Novella you can cue information on it that gives you more a feel for the  state of the time period which is quite fascinating.                  Ezio as a character is a lot better and more filled  out then the unemotional cipher that was Altair which is appreciated if  you want to get into the story at all. His character arch is a story of  revenge and conspiracy. The other characters you meet while in Italy are  pretty interesting including Uncle Mario, an Italian mercenary, who  says an unexpectedly hilarious line during his introduction and Theodora  a nun turned pimp. Also you are introduced to a soon to be friend  Leonardo da Vinci who helps you throughout your journey. The only  characters I dreaded and luckily did not have to interact with that much  is the annoying British character Shaun and the tom boy tech girl who  are both on Assassin's side and are both annoying and bland characters.  The villains are interesting, mainly circulating around the political  leaders at the time, that include the eccentric Pazzi family and the  backstabbing Barbarigo family of Venice each with their own bag of  crazy. Also the guards of each city that you encounter can be a big o'  bag of fun as well. As such with open world games the animations of  characters are prone to turn erratic and crazy which was the case with  one guard in Venice I encountered. I was trying to get the No-Hitter  achievement and so I was fighting this big group of guards and after I  killed one he must have bumped into another guard or something because  his rag doll physics continued to shoot him up in the air significantly  high to land across the town square. The graphics and art style of the  characters and cities are the same as the first game with a little fine  tuning but the world that is produced is a beautiful one that you will  have fun exploring in.                 New weapons are introduced to provide more ways to  dole out your assassination prowess to unsuspecting guards. The double  hidden blades with poison for instance allow you to do double air  assassinations until your heart is content and the poison brings an  interesting mechanic in which you can quietly poison a guard and watch  him flip out waving his arms and sword erratically through the air and  attack his fellow guards and passersby. The only problem is that the  mechanics can be rather finicky at times. The camera while running on  the roof tops of the cities can be a pain because if you move it in the  wrong direction you may end up jumping off the building to your death.  Really though this is to be expected from what game has to contend with,  a character doing crazy parkore moves, running every which way, across  and off roof tops but still it can get frustrating. Also an adjustment  is the addition of the notoriety system that shows how much the guards  are suspicious of Ezio based on your actions in the game.                One of the more interesting parts of the game is  exploring the background of the Assassin-Templar conflict by finding  special glyphs around the cities that has you go through a series of  puzzles to unlock cinematics that become cohesive once you found them  all which also tells reveals more about the Pieces of Eden how and why  the Templars use them and how the Assassins stop them like implying that  Nikolai Tesla was an Assassin and Thomas Edison was a Templar which is  pretty cool. Also you can collect codex pages in each city that  elucidates the goings on of Altair after the first Assassin's Creed. The  other collectibles like the paintings from Renaissance Italian artists  like Leonardo and Giotto and Petruccio feathers are used as improvements  for your family villa in Monteriggioni that Uncle Mario lets you use as  home base for your missions.               The improvement of your villa introduces the economy  mechanic of the game which introduces Art Merchants, Blacksmiths,  Clothiers and Doctors as shops to get weapons and medicine from. The Art  Merchants provide paintings from contemporary Italian artists to deck  out your villa and also treasure maps that show where the pointless  treasure chests are scattered throughout the cities. The reason they are  pointless is that they give you little incentive to look for them  besides giving you a little bit of money which if you renovate the villa  enough through your personal architect you will get all the money you  need so making the player search for the treasure chests pointless. As  you improve your villa it will go from a run down mess that you start  with to a vibrant and colorful town. The Blacksmiths provide you with  new weapons and a place to repair your armor which gets worn out and  damaged after prolonged wear. Also Blacksmiths and Doctors provide a  repository for medicine, poison and ammunition for your different  weapons. Clothiers provide item upgrades for the amount of items you can  carry and clothing dye that only has the cosmetic effect of changing  the color of your outfit.              There is also a ""faction"" system that allows you to  enlist the help of thieves, mercenaries, and prostitutes that are in  every city who help you blend in with the citizens to avoid the  attention of the guards or help to fight and distract them while you run  away. I use faction loosely because it is definitely not in the same  vain as Mercenaries in which you balance attitudes between them. They  also help you with your main assassination missions allowing you to move  incognito while you narrow the distance between you and your target.               The main missions are fun and pretty varied like saving  some helpful NPCs or going after targets in different locales holding  the same formula as the first game true. The revision of the primary  missions of the first game that seemed like side missions are now  optional and officially side missions where the reward upon completion  is money. The assassination contract side missions seemed to be too many  and too much of the same thing with the only difference is if the  mission is timed or not. Other then that the races and beat 'em up  missions are still available. Also there is a new side mission in which  you explore the tombs of Ezio's ancestors which requires you to go  through a lot of jumping puzzles to collect their seal for a strong  outfit after you collect all six of them.  The only sad part is once you  do all the missions and grab the collectibles there is little to no  re-playability afterward so once you experience Assassin's Creed 2,  you're done.                All in all Assassin's Creed 2 is an improvement to the  previous installment while providing the same parkore, running on roof  tops and assassinating targets game play goodness from the first. It  improves on the combat by providing different weapons to use, a more  dynamic fight and counterattack system and more equipment to deal out  stealth kills with. I enjoyed the story more then the last one and the  crazy turn the game has towards the end will leave a ""what the fuck""  feeling. The art style is still easy on the eyes and the cities are  still fun to run around in. Also if you like history or Renaissance  Italy this game will be of interest with the background information on  the world you are exploring included which is cool and interesting to  read. Assassin's Creed 2 gives more of what I liked about Assassin's  Creed 1 while improving on its faults.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Now ive played none in the series until now but after playing the sequel i now am not only getting the first one but its now arguably my favorite sandbox game, and one of my favorite series.Italians have a great culture, Italy being the home of two great happenings in history that shaped and invented the western world, The Roman Empire & The Renaissance, and i thank this developer for involving Italians in a video game and not focusing on some mafia BS or some common stereotype thats associated in every Italian-American video game or film. Extreme gratitude to this developer for showing Italians too can have a great history based game, not just the British, and thats another thing props for getting actual italian accents instead of being lazy and just using British accents like they do for most settings in Europe, indeed i notice the small things like this. The medeval age in games gets old, the beautiful colors and architecture of Italy is definately far more easier on the eyes than the rugged uninspired constant shade of grey stone (England) but enough of that. Mixing Science fiction and the past is nothing new i'm sure, weve all seen the dozens of sci fi flicks involving Cowboys vs Aliens, but Assassins Creed is in a leaque of its own. Its rare for a game to be both Original & Intelligent. Usualy in video games i care nothing about collecting such meaningless things as ""Codex"" & ""Gyphs"", these are but chores and annoyances in most games, but AC2 made me search for every single damn one, because its story, the entire synopsis & the lore is top knotch, the writers succeeded in making a game with a complex in depth back story of mystery, and they succeeded even further with tying it all together with historical characters and inventors of the past, the game succeeded in mixing mystery & sci fi where most fail cough Prototype cough. And also pioneered new technology in the sci fi video game genre (yes i'm well aware of genetic memory as a theory and in Sci fi themes before, but you name me another machine that does exactly what the Animus does), i'm counting the days till we see some ""Animus"" clone in another game. The gameplay is simple but it gets the job done, the parkour is amazingly done, much more in depth & fun to execute than in previous titles such as ""inFamous"" or ""Prototype"" games where parkour involve rapidly pressing the X button and a game that did it all for you. The sword play again is simple but it gets the job done you can't just go all ""Psycho sword wielding bastard FTW"" on everyone in some cases strategy is the way to go, that or climbing on a building pulling out the pistol and capping some mofo's. The characters are likable and voice acting is top knotch, did i mention that the game was beautiful? not just graphicaly but Ubi soft Montreal succeeded in the designing of Italy to such detail one cannot help but notice.The game is sure to please those who can appreciate those who love a history, mystery & sci fi filled action adventure, by all means Assassins creed II is a gem in a sea of mediocrity .  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ To be up front and blunt I hated the first Assassin's Creed. I didn't  understand where all the hype was from. Yes the game was beautiful on a  strictly graphics plane but that didn't take away from all the other  pitfalls the plagued my experience with the original. So needless to say  when I was contemplating getting the second it was a big reach for me  to put myself out there after they had burned me last time. I am so  happy to say my fears were for not. Assassin's Creed 2 corrects every  issue that the original had in one way or another.    As far as a game play experience goes this game goes above and beyond expectations and blurs that ever discussed line between video gaming and the art industries. How can you not look at a game this miraculous and not see that it takes the same kind of dedication to create something this visually impressive as it does to create art on a canvas. The only difference is this is done with computers, and using the technology we have now to go beyond everything people can imagine in a video game. But I digress.  As far as the game goes with it's capabilities it does run into a few technical issues here or there but they are easily overlooked unless you feel the need to nitpick everything. Sometimes there will be a glitch or two but after some of the other games I've played doomed to hell by glitches and mediocre patches to fix them. This game is a shining light of hope on the horizon. Graphically the game is top notch I would rate the graphics found within Assassin's Creed to be superb.  As far as the difficulty goes I would really enjoy for the third installment if they actually gave you the option to change the settings of the game but all in all it will give you a decent challenge at some points but at others it will seem like you are indeed infallible, which you are a damn Master Assassin so go figure.  The User Interface in the game is top notch, very easily assessable and friendly to navigate within.  The controls for the game are tight and the mechanics of the game are very smooth operating. Making for a very fluid use of all of your skills and abilities, much quicker reaction times then it's predecessor as well.  Storyline in the game is better then the first, which that could be only an opinion but damn it to hell it's a right one. The storyline keeps you on your toes with a few interesting twists and turns and the little side quests you can do offer a nice break up in the experience so you can take a few moments doing a little task and admiring just how great the game is constructed.  As for the length of the journey you embark on? I guess that depends on the person. You'll get your money's worth out of a solid play through. Then again I did every single thing possible in the game and DLC content because the game was worth spending time doing tasks that weren't garnering any sort of report on my achievement score, and that is worth a damn lot to me at this point.  If you want a solid game and something you won't want to put down until you deliver the final fatal blow then pick this game up, and get ready for one hell of a ride.  InKtOiD]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[This what i wanted from the first game but that failed and just got boring fast. but with AC2 i had so much fun, the stealth is so much fun and the kills are great and like the first one things to get boring but they add some cool stuff through the story but i got to say i hate them racing missions they pissed me off.  The story is about this game is the best and the characters and i do like the added building stuff for your uncle mario and i do like how things go on and the towns are great and adding other assains is great near the ending a really good game but its not 100% right but its just a fun game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed II is a game that received a lot of attention during the past couple of months. It's been nominated for the Game of the Year 2009 award at several websites, and gotten all positive reviews. There's been some talk about a buggy PS3 release, but don't believe the hype, I played the PS3 version and didn't notice a thing wrong with it. ACII is a sequel to a game that was very innovating, groundbreaking, and even though the story of the first chapter was somewhat underdeveloped and boring; the gameplay made up for that in a very satisfying way. The sequel does not disappoint in any way, it's bigger, it's better, and even more spectacular than the first game.  First a couple of words about the story, which seems to be the biggest improvement. Players who walked the path of Altair in the first game were mostly disappointed with the ending that provided no closure, and very little to look forward to. The only thing that was obvious at the end of Assassin's Creed was that there is gonna be a sequel. The first game left me thinking “what, that it?”. Not in this one though. In ACII you continue with two parallel storylines, just like in the first game, but this time around it's far more interesting, intense, and addictive. In the “real world” you're still the bartender Desmond, but once you jump into the Animus the story takes you to 16 century Italy, where you become Ezio, whose character can be described as the ruff ryder of his time. Ezio is badass from the start, and he becomes even badder during the course of the game. When the character is first introduced he's a playa, son of a rich and influential Florentine family. He does a little of streetfighting, a little bit of sneaking into girls' bedrooms at night, you know, the regular grind. But then the larger part of his family gets killed and Ezio is out for blood, bound to kill every single motherfucker responsible for this crime, which leads him into a very intricate and widespread conspiracy. As a result he will visit Florence, Venice and Rome, all presented in stunning visual design. And he'll do a lot of killing too. Ok, enough spoilers.  I feel like this one thing has to be said, though. It seems that the creators of Assassin's Creed II are following the trend which begun with “The DaVinci Code” and other Dan Brown books. It's hard not to make that comparison because of how the story develops. I guess the hype isn't over and the world still craves conspiracy theories based on the Catholic Church, and its plots how to gain control over the world. In this respect Assassin's Creed II creates its own conspiracy universe, which is believable up to a certain point, but in my opinion, it resembles the horrible novels too much. Fortunately the ending of the game completely breaks off from this curse and just makes you shake in your seat waiting for ACIII. For now just focus on killing Christians (for me that's enough of a reason to play any game).  Essentially the gameplay mechanics have not changed since the first game. If you played the original Assassin's Creed you'll be able to jump right in, because the control scheme is exactly the same, as well as all the combat and movement mechanics. You'll still see an artistically brutal animation after performing a successful counterattack, and the new weapons make stabbing, throat-slitting and cutting even more fun.  The two major changes in gameplay make a lot of sense, and feel like something that a sequel should have, especially that the core is basically the same as in the original. The first new thing in Assassin's Creed II is the existence of money. And man, you'll need that money. It can be used for a variety of things, the most important of which are the upgrades you can buy for your stronghold (a village that you kinda own, the Assassin's HQ, if you will), and new weapons and armor. This time you won't just be given better weapons as you progress through the story, you're gonna have to buy your own stuff. Money can also be used to distract guards (throw some money on the ground and see people fighting for it like... *racist joke here*), hire courtesans (also to distract the guards, not for your own pleasure, sadly), thieves, and mercenaries.  The second change introduced in ACII is huge and alters the experience, makes the game less repetitive, and basically just moves you forward quicker. Remember how in the first game you had to gather intel on your assassination targets before you could actually kill them? It was always the same stuff, like eavesdropping or beating somebody up for conversation. It was boring. Fortunately, all this was completely removed from the game. Now you just go from point A to point B, just follow the exclamation mark on your map. Now the general mission structure goes like this: you find out who you have to kill, you prepare the diversion on gain access to the necessary building, and then proceed straight to the kill. It may not sound like much, but trust me, it's in every way better, more interesting and satisfying.  All that said, you don't need to be in a rush to do anything. The missions will patiently wait for you as you explore the open world and take on the side missions and activities, which are a good way of making money, even if they're not really anything new. What got me hooked on ACII is the exploration. Just running on rooftops and climbing church towers is fun enough to do nothing else, and the visual presentation is quite stunning. The artistic design team really did a wonderful job at recreating Florence and Venice, the cities look alive, and probably resemble the real historic places a lot.    You can say a lot about this game, but the bottom line still is that it's a game about stabbing dudes in the face. And now that you have two hidden blades you can stab two dudes at the same time. How cool is that?  I tried hard to find something bad to say about ACII, but just couldn't come up with anything. Finally after replaying the first half of the game, still the only bad thing I can say about it is that maybe it's a little too easy. If you don't fall from a great hight, or do something really stupid, it's almost impossible to die. Seriously, the game is a little too easy. But in the overall picture, it really doesn't matter because the execution of the whole is so perfect.]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Might I borrow this SirI picked up assassin's Creed when it first came out. I thought "" Wow here is a game that looks like it could be fun."" Oh how wrong I was *facepalm* Assassin's creed was a constant repetitive task list. Follow this guy Pick Pocket that guy. Jump that other guy. I Didn't pick up Assassin's Creed II because i didn't want to waste my money on another repetitive task manager. Oh how wrong i was AGAIN *facepalm* When i picked up Assassin's Creed II and threw it in the good ol' 360 i was amazed. The Ubisoft team did away with all the repetitive tasks and actually made the game intresting. With a worthwhile story, and some intresting gameplay mechanics it was alluring. i like that they moved from the emotionless  Altaïr, to this young brash italian kid named Ezio Auditore. It gave some life to the game. It makes you simpithize with the charector. Over all an intresting story coupled with great gameplay mechanics results in an intresting and addictive title. It makes You crave the next game in the seriese and sware never to go back to the old ways of assassinating templars]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[  I gotta say, I'm ridiculously impressed at this  franchise's sophomore offering. Quite possibly the largest leap forward  from sequel I've seen.+'sThe combat system is fun and versatile.  The combat is rhythmic with attacks, parries, dodging, disarming and a  bunch of running around. You'll be in battles against upwards of 10  enemies at once and on some occasions, there'll be a huge fight going on  all around you with multiple factions fighting. The combat is improved  from the first game and it works very well. It's entertaining and you  can do a lot of different things.The parkour style free running and climbing is done very well.  Basically all Assassin's Creed 1 had was it's parkour free running and  this game improves on an already great system. You run around and climb  buildings like a freaking spider and it all looks great. Every now and  again you'll stop because there's nothing above you to grab onto, but  after a while you start to take notice of what's a good path to take and  what's not.The graphics are top shelf. If you see any screens or videos of this game, you can tell it looks very pretty.The different environments are actually pretty different and accurate to the real deal.  You go to multiple cities and they all look very different from each  other. I could tell you which one of the cities I'm in by just running  around a bit in the streets. Each city has a distinct flavor.All the little throw ins with historical figures was nicely done.  You'll meet plenty of historical figures and it's not all in your face.  Most of the time they're just in the background but it's cool that  they're there.Almost everything in the game has a moderately detailed description just in case you're interested.  From historical people to art works to buildings, there's an incredible  amount of information available to read. If you do actually read it, it  really gives the game a sense of history and makes it all the more  immersive to be running around in these locales. Collection in the game yields rewards.  Running around and picking up the various collectibles actually give  you something in game that's worth having. I'll just leave it at that.The Villa you own and upgrade is a nice touch. You can spend your money on upgrading areas in your Villa. It's not very deep but it's a fun side quest of sorts.The voice acting in the game is incredible.  Not only is it great in english, if you choose to you can have them  speak Italian w/subtitles. And even if it's in english, they have an  Italian accent. Great voice acting all around.The story was very good and kept things moving along. I really liked this game's story and powered through the main quest just to see how it ended.The ending was one hell of a mind fuck.  And what a freaking ending it was. Try to avoid any spoilers having to  do with the story of this game if you plan on playing it. Craaaaazy  ending.='sThe character model's faces were a bit off.  This is only noticeable because of the high quality in the rest of the  games visuals. Mainly, I'm kinda weirded out by the Veronica Mars  chick's face in the game but that's because she's a real person and I  think they tried to make the model her. Still, some weird faces in the  game but most are solid.Sometimes running from one end of the city to the other would take a bit too long.  These cities are HUUUGE and when you have to run from one end to the  other. . . it can take almost 10 minutes just to make a beeline to the  other side.The game can't help it but the loading in between cities. Yea, loading sucks. . . but it's typically only between cities so it's not that bad.-'sCan't think of anything overly negative. Everything is at least average with most of it being excellent. So  I came into this not expecting much even after having seen a couple  glowing reviews. This game pretty much does everything you wanted the  first game to do. It's no longer the same mission over and over again,  and you don't just sit around on benches waiting for people to talk  about stuff. The game is a great step forward and I'm actually looking  forward to the next one in the franchise. That's not a normal thing in  video games as far as I can think of. Maybe movies I'll want the next  one to come out so I can see it, but games tend to be contained to where  I don't think about what's next. . . maaaaybe Mass Effect wanting Mass  Effect 2 but right now, I just want Assassin's Creed 3.4.5/5Steve ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[By - Richard J.Remember back to 2006 and 2007 when everyone was so excited for 'Assassin's Creed', set to be released for the Xbox360 and PS3? Gamers around the world were so excited for a game that was set to change the way we thought of sandbox games. The hype coursed through the internet, and it coursed thorough our veins in anticipation, but something happened. Eager gamers rushed through Assassin's Creed and were met by disappointment. The game looked great and played fairly well, but the terrible repetition killed the game for many.Fast forward to November 2010. The sequel, Assassin's Creed 2 is finally released. Many gamers, including my self, were cautiously optimistic of this game. Ubisoft told us again and again that they changed what made the first game terrible, and they were set to deliver what the original was supposed to be. Luckily, Ubisoft came through with that promise and released Assassin's Creed 2, which was always a contender for Game Of the Year contests on every gaming site and blog. They really did take what ruined the first game and improved on it, which I will explain here.Let's start with the gameplay. This part remained mostly the same from the original Assassin's Creed. You're an assassin who runs through crowded streets and scales large buildings, assassinating those who have wronged you. The main gameplay change in Assassin's Creed 2 is the ability to swim. This is a great addition to the game, especially towards the end. The swimming controls are easy to use and don't cause any major problems. Sometimes you won't swim exactly where you want to go, but that is a gripe you can also have with the running and jumping. The other addition is the ability to sail boats. This is a great addition to the game in the sense of how it mixes up the gameplay a bit, but the game doesn't really utilize it. There are only a handful of missions that use it and it's always just more convenient to run. You'll really have to force yourself to use the boat if you are interested in it.While that isn't a big change from the original, the variety of missions is. In the first Assassin's Creed, you're missions were basically to either pickpocket, follow to gain intelligence, kill a group of guards, or assassinate someone. Not to mention collecting flags. That got really boring and ruined the original for most people. In Assassin's Creed 2 however, the missions are much more varied. You'll do everything from caring boxes for someone to flying. The game does a much better job of keeping the player interested and engaged. I did however have some problems with the first missions. For most of the first section of memory, you're spent doing very boring and rudimentary tasks, such as caring boxes. If you're like me and were on the fence about Assassin's Creed 2, then this definitely doesn't help your purchasing decision. Luckily, if you stick with the game, you'll find the missions become much more interesting and rewarding.Another great addition to Assassin`s Creed 2 is the monetary system. Now you have the ability to purchase weapons and medicine with money which you can collect throughout the game world. This will have you ruthlessly stealing and looting. You`ll be stealing from peoples houses as if you were in a JRPG (Zing!).The story in Assassin's Creed 2 is much more interesting than that of the original. In Assassin's Creed 2, you play Ezio Auditore and you're goal is to assassinate those who are responsible for the death of your father and two brothers. This is the main idea of the story, but it branches out to much more. Desmond also has a bit of a story outside of the animus which is a welcome addition for this character that you don't know much about in the first game.The graphics in Assassin's Creed 2 are still top notch. The animations are smooth and the frame rate rarely drops, even with so many NPCs in a small area. The water glistens and the buildings shimmer. Assassin's Creed 2 is without a doubt one of the best looking games out there. The music that you will here in the background as you play also adds a lot to the game and is the icing on the cake that is this wonderful game.As for lasting appeal, this game doesn`t have much. Once you are completed all the missions, all you can do is run through the city as you are unable to replay missions. There is some DLC for the game that has been released, but it`s pretty poor and is not necessarily worth your time and money. Assassin`s Creed 2 is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original. Fans of sandbox and stealth games will love this game and those who don`t will still enjoy it. It`s one of the best of last year and a welcome addition to any gamers collection.PROS- More Mission Variety- Interesting Story- Addition of Monetary System- Amazing Graphics- Delightful Music and AudioCONS- Can Be Boring At First- Sometimes It`s Hard To Control Where You Want Ezio to Jump or Swim- Need to Buy DLC to Complete the Entire Story- Not Much Replay ValueRATING: 8.75/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[It's a strange time to have just finished Assasins Creed 2, a year after its release and with Brotherhood now on the shelves. It's taken me a year to complete after being sidetracked by other games but the 20 or so hours I have spent playing it have definately been enjoyable ones.   Assasins Creed 2 does do well in developing all aspects of the original, AC1 was often said to be very repetetive and AC2 does it's best to alleviate this by adding many more tasks to prevent the gameplay from being so much of a case of deja vu. The world of AC2 has sidequests, more to explore, more things to find, more puzzles, more story, more everything. However at times for the completionist such as myself you can get bogged down in the same repetition as the first and perhaps to an even greater degree as there is far more to do. For example climbing towers to see the world in AC1 was repetative, while there are a wider variety of tasks to do in AC2 there are a lot more towers to climb than before.   The game takes place directly on from the first one, with Desmond escaping the Templars and entering a different Animus to be a different assasin, Ezio. Ezio has a lot more life to him the Altair ever had, and has a big cast of interesting support characters to back him up in the games Renaissance Italy setting. The game takes place across many cities with good varaiation to the environments both in the city walls and outside, the game manages to create a wonderful level of immersion with it's good story and strong setting.   Ezio divides his time between many activities. The main plotline involves stealth missions, chase sequences, set battles, and using every skill and weapon in Ezio's every growing arsenal. At one point you even fly over Venice using a flying machine built by Leonardo Da Vinci whi plays a prominent role in the story. Along with the main plot there are many other activites, collecting chests, rebuilding Ezio's base city to be prosperous, finding the tombs of assasins of old in order to unlock powerful armour as well as piecing together a code hidden in the fabric of the animus.   The huge amount of activites are mostly a lot of fun with a few noticable exceptions. Stealth missions do not tend to work well and with optional assasination contracts often having sections where you can't be seen and doing so meaning an instant game over, frustration ensues. The stealth sections in the main plot are weak too purely because the mechanics do not work well and leave you wondering how a guard saw you or why the over sensetive controls led to you randomely climbing a wall and losing your target or falling in front of some watchful guards. The controls can be quite twitchy at times which causes the elaborate often time limited platforming sequences in the games assasin tombs to be frustrating too. Ezio will sometimes leap in the wrong direction unless you take sections you need to take speedily slowly, and you can find yourself falling which leads to death or having to attempt the platforming section many times.     Visually the game is stunning, the cities are huge and expansive and a joy to behold. The games musical score is also spot on, and makes the game feel like a blockbuster film. Voice acting wise things are spot on, the cast speak with great accents, sometimes in Italian to excencuate certain lines and this adds to the immersion brilliantly. Cutscenes can have some truly ""lol"" moments and everyone puts in a stirring performance.   Overall, AC2 is AC1 but more polished. A good thing. It still has it's flaws but you can forgive yourself to overlook some of it's frustrations and repetition to enjoy Ezio's beautiful world.   ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Having scratched my head about how the first Assassin's Creed sold so well after hearing the numerous criticisms, I approached this game with a healthy dose of skepticism.  Having finished the lengthy quest after picking up and putting down the game over the course of several months, I can say that there is a lot to love here, although I'm not sure the things I loved were the things the developers wanted me to love.  Loved -Reaching the viewpoints - while it seems crazy that my favorite part of the game involved climbing up a wall//tower/high place and standing there, I can say without hesitation that they were my favorite part of the game.  The music, the gorgeous environments, the sweeping camera, the feeling of freedom:  They all work together to create an amazing series of moments as you progress through the game.  -The Assassin's Tombs - There are six hidden tombs in the game that offer a variety of gameplay from puzzles, to platforming, to stealth assassinations.  These are easily the best missions in the game by a mile.  In fact, the game could have just been Assassin tombs, and I would have been completely satisfied.  They simply must be played to be appreciated and I commend the development team for the excellent level design.  -The Environments - This game is really gorgeous.  While it is a simple statement, words can't do justice to the breathtaking cities, landscapes, and lighting detail throughout the game.  Although I'm sure there are games that have more graphical horsepower under the hood, the overall visual impression left by the game was probably only matched by Uncharted 2 in my mind.    -The Movement System - The game controls are very well designed and perfectly suited to keep you quickly moving through the city at a nimble pace while somewhat grounding the feel on movement in realism (although Ezio can climb like a monkey in certain moments).  I had more fun just running between buildings and scaling walls to get to the next viewpoint than I would have guessed and few other games can match the shear joy of experience by just moving around the world.  Hated  -The Story - Having spent many hours with this game, I find it surprising that I would struggle so much to describe what actually happened.  Other than Ezio, the main character, the game is a mess of throwaway characters and horrendous dialogue mashed together with a confusing Sci-Fi plot.  I definitely finished this game in spite of the story as I quickly grew bored of the story Ubisoft threw in front of me.  The best example of this is the poor way the game conveys the passage of time.  The game takes place over several years apparently, which is only really told to the player towards the end of the game rather than revealed during the course of the game.  It was just one example of the poor storytelling throughout this game.   -The Combat - While I think they are onto something with the counterattacking and over-the-top assassination animations, the system just doesn't work as advertised.  Unless you can coax the enemy into attacking you and thus initiating a one-hit kill counterattack (which takes too much effort), you  will be stuck hacking away for a minute just to cut down one guard.  While I appreciate that the counterattack is the focus of the combat, the timing of the input needed isn't precise or consistent enough to make the player feel empowered.  Given that games like God of War have figured this formula out years ago, I was surprised that this game struggled so much in this department.    -The load times - while I can appreciate the technical achievement in this game, I am really just sick of load times in general.  The load times here are annoying and present more than I would have expected.  While they won't appear while you're staying in a single town (thank god), I feel like we should be beyond load times this long at this point.  -The pacing/game length - considering the rubbish story I got, I don't understand why they had to drag things out so long.  Much of the game consists of stupid fetch quests that artificially add length to an already long game.  The only mitigating factor is the fact to movement in the game is so fun, taking some of the sting off of going back and forth.   -Not getting my trophy for finishing the game - while a minor gripe, I was kind of miffed by the fact that the game is buggy enough that I didn't get my trophy for completing the game when I beat it.   Assassin's Creed 2 has some very high highs and low lows.  Overall, the things the game gets right were very memorable and unlike many things I have played before.  While I wouldn't universally recommend this game, I can see why it sold so well and why so many people enjoyed it.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ Of all the genres that have benefitted from ever-more powerful hardware, the action-stealth-platformer has reached perhaps the most dizzying new heights this generation. Led by standard-setters like Uncharted 2, Batman: Arkham Asylum and Metal Gear Solid 4, this genre routinely shows off the state-of-the-art in graphics technology, scripting, voice acting, sound design, level design, and on and on. Assassin's Creed II easily joins the top of that list with its immaculate art direction and photo-realistic depiction of Renaissance-era Italian cities. The writing staff also ups their game with a twisting, mystery-filled tale that would give an X-Files episode a run for its money in the intrigue department. Lead protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a more personable frontman this time around and generally gives you an avator to root for. Character development in general is a little flat, as you'll frequently be hunting down figures you generally don't care or know much about, despite the game's numerous cutscenes and codex pop-ups. Your allies are also a little cardboard-ish in personality, so don't expect any meaningful attachment to any characters you encounter in this franchise. AC II surprisingly airs on the longer side of single-player adventuring, easily clocking in at more than 20 or 30 hours of gametime, depending on how extensive your side-questing takes you.  The semi-open world of AC II is generally a pleasure to explore, if not quite as rewarding or expansive as something like Red Dead Redemption or Fallout 3. Your travel options are taken farther off the rails than something as tightly directed as Uncharted 2, as you can freely advance throughout most of the world at your own pace. Trouble is, there just isn't that much to do outside of plowing through the core story-based missions. There are a lot of inconsequential side-missions and random collectibles if you're into that sort of thing. Everything you collect has an incremental effect on how much income you generate per 20 minutes of gametime (cleverly handled as ""rental income"" on your family's estate), but the ""unlocking"" system, as it is, never feels as addictive or empowering as other examples of this, like the Ratchet & Clank series or various multiplayer shooters. Combat in the first Assassin's Creed was a mess, and AC II offers a slight improvement. It still feels clunky and unsatisfying, frequently devolving into non-responsive button mashing as you take on any group larger than 1 or 2 enemies. Weapons and gadgets remain unimpressive to use. And while platforming feels great from an animation and control perspective, it's still largely limited to scaling buildings and jumping between rooftops. A series of six tombs (unrequired for completion purposes) offers a more impressive platforming experience, taking you through imaginative cave and cathedral interiors. It's a shame these natural environments and creative sequences aren't integrated more widely in the overall game. All in all, AC II is a notable, if not spectacular, example of one of the most ambitious genres in gaming today.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I never played the original Assassin’s Creed. When it was releasing the previews never appealed to me and the general buzz around the game seemed to be that it had a lot of good ideas but executed them poorly.  When its sequel released I had already written the series off despite the positive remarks I kept hearing about it.  With the release of Brotherhood and seeing it become a game of the year contender, I decided I had to finally jump into the series.  With minimal knowledge of the original game, I picked up a copy of Assassin’s Creed II determined to find out what all the fuss was about.  For those who are unaware, Assassin’s Creed II is an open-world game with a strong emphasis on exploration and on-foot traversal.  The controls are especially key to how the majority of the gameplay takes place.  It forgoes the common mechanics of just jump and grab buttons for exploration and replaces them with the ability to “free-run,” which automates much of the climbing and jumping for the player.  Taking that layer of concentration away from the player allows them to focus more on where they’re going, strategize about the upcoming assassination, or keep an eye out for one of the seemingly endless number of collectibles available throughout the game.  While not perfect, the system is essential to how Assassin’s Creed II plays and it's hard to imagine the game without it.   Planning your assassinations is made easier by simplifying movement.     The overarching story of Assassin’s Creed follows Desmond Miles, an outlaw with an assassin’s heritage, and his training through a device known as the Animus that allows him to relive his ancestor’s key memories.  That, however, exists as a frame around which the game tells the story of one of Desmond’s ancestors, Ezio.  In his quest to avenge a great injustice done to his family, Ezio traverses many of Italy’s major cities and meets a diverse and interesting cast of characters.  Ezio himself slowly shifts into his role as an assassin at a believable pace and his confident and commanding personality gives the impression that he’s always in control, even when he may not be.  His sense of confidence helps some of the more fantastical elements of the story feel believable.  Ezio's tale is so complex and intriguing that it sometimes becomes easy to forget that the layer of the Animus and Desmond even exist. The story missions themselves are very impressive as well.  The game segments each set of missions into sequences with early missions of a new sequence paying off with a large-scale battle or assassination to end it.  The main mission thread never falls into a repetitious rut and keeps the tasks varied, from assassinations to driving a carriage under attack to even piloting Da Vinci’s flying machine.  It’s a wonderfully guided experience that never outstays its welcome and is one of the finest points of Assassin’s Creed II.   The primary thread of missions provide a lot of variety.      As an open world game with a compelling story, it could be easy for the wonderfully populated world to feel wasted and empty if the player chooses to ignore all the non-story content.  To avoid that, Assassin’s Creed II manages a notoriety mechanic.  As you assassinate and kill guards and other important figures through side missions or story missions, your notoriety will rise and guards will hassle you more and more based on how notorious you are in an area.  At max notoriety, guards will even attack you on sight.  To keep everything in check you can rip down wanted posters, bribe heralds, or assassinate people spreading lies about your deeds.  In such an expansive world it’s important to break up the linear path of the story with side tasks like these and can even make the player more interested in the large assortment of side-missions available.  The ancillary content in Assassin’s Creed II is some of the most interesting I’ve seen in an open world game.  It’s rich with missions including races, assassination contracts, waypoints, and catacomb puzzles reminiscent of the Prince of Persia titles.  Each mission type feels completely different from the others and unique in their own way.  It has a very open interpretation of how to accomplish goals in the side-missions which gives the player a better sense of freedom.  Assassinating a target may sound simple, but if he’s surrounded by guards or in a restricted area the task suddenly gets a bit more complex and the game offers a lot of different ways to tackle the same problems, many of which are introduced in the story missions.  Being an assassin is just that badass sometimes.     The payoff for pulling off a major assassination is fantastic.  There’s a strong sense of power and control from leaping off a building and landing on a target for the kill or even calmly strutting up to the target and quietly putting a blade in his back.  Almost all of the assassinations, especially the story driven ones, are exhilarating and the best singular moments of the game.  Unfortunately, an assassination is usually followed by a large number of guards gathering around you for a large-scale fight, which isn’t nearly as interesting.  The fighting mechanics don’t have near the same sense of power that the assassinations do.  As guards circle around you and attack you one by one, the best solution for the player is just to counter whatever they throw at you.  If you have a group of people fighting with you, you can calmly walk behind each enemy and perform a single-hit kill until they're all dead.  For a game that feels so natural and fluid, the combat is very clunky and unimaginative.  It’s disappointing that the large scale fights aren't nearly as compelling as so many other parts of the game. The waypoints are a standout piece of side-mission content that deserve adulation.  Waypoints are the tallest buildings in a general area that the player must scale in order to display new sections of the map.  The waypoint buildings, in that sense, become vertical puzzles in the open world.  As new areas open up to the player, a new amount of waypoints are unlocked for them to take on.  It’s a very simple task, but the feeling of climbing to the top of a massive building and peering over the edge is one that few games can replicate.  It’s hard to get a sense for how massive each town truly is until you can see it from the tallest spots available.  A lot of my thoughts on Assassin’s Creed II are probably things that the first game did as well, but I didn’t feel lost at all making the 2nd in the series my first experience.  I was immediately impressed by the well realized world, fluidity of the controls, and how grand everything felt as I jumped rooftop to rooftop in search of more tall buildings to climb.  The combat is really my only disappointment in the game, and by my understanding Brotherhood does a lot to remedy this.  If you have stayed out of the Assassin’s Creed franchise until now like I have, then I absolutely recommend giving Assassin's Creed II a chance.  As for me, I’m just itching to get my hands on the most recent release.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2  has such a polarizing a effect on me for several different reasons. The first game in the series was impressive for several reasons. It established a wonderful universe with some really interesting characters and a wonderful conspiracy theory look on some classic history. On the same token though it suffered from some significant game play problems such as repetition, wonky controls and aggressive AI. The second game in this series pretty much plods along the same path as its predecessor and improves in some areas and only seems to highlight the frustrations of its older sibling.   Technically Assassin's Creed 2 is an impressive game. It is one of the best graphically looking games on the Xbox 360 and it truly ""wow's"" the player with the immensity of the towns in the game. New additions to the game such as the Villa and the money system are welcome and nicely implemented. The developers even did an excellent job alleviating some of the repetitive side quests this time around too.  Despite all of that though the game suffers from some of the same problems as the first game and they often times appear more flagrant this time around simply because you know they are carrying over from the first game.   The most notable of the frustrations from the first game that carried over is the manic running/jumping system as you traverse the buildings. When it works it is bliss, but I still found so many times in the game where my character would almost sporadically jump in the wrong direction, plunging me to my death. There was a level of common sense from the AI that seemed to fail and I more than once found my same actions on the controller result in different actions (making or not making a jump) at the same location in the game. The second biggest downfall I found for this game was perhaps the side quests. In short the side quests are still terribly boring. Some of the droll from the first game was alleviated simply because there were fewer side quests, but on the whole they have not been improved.   All that said though the game shines in three key areas. First off it is gorgeous!!!! The cities, the people within them, and the environments are wonderfully done and truly immersive. Never before in a game have I truly felt like I was in an living, breathing city. The second area is the storyline. In this game the player gets a much deeper look at the world behind the pieces of eden and we get to see a sneak peak of what the grand story is here. The ending is almost as impressive as the twist in BioShock and really lays down the groundwork for a great third game in the trilogy.  Finally and perhaps the biggest improvement is that the enemy soldiers are toned down in their aggressiveness. One of the toughest experiences in the first game was that in the late game, navigating any of the cities became frustrating and hindered the overall story progression. In this game the soldiers are much more tempered to your existence which helps tremendously in the forward progression of the story.  All said and done though, the game does nothing to really change the core mechanics from the first game. Fighting is still defensive, running on roof tops is still there. Pickpocketing, eavesdropping, and sneaking around is all built in. While there are some fine points tuned, the major flaws from the first game still exist and if you are not hooked by the storyline from the first game you are not going to be drawn into this next chapter in the Assassin's Creed story.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[      In 2007 Assassin's Creed was a much anticipated game that met mixed criticism. It felt like the building blocks were there but the pieces never really fell into place. It was a good starting point for a series that could only get better. Assassin's Creed II is the sequel to that game and is a great improvement over the first game. While the first game felt like a core story wrapped around several mini games the sequel feels like a full fleshed out game, an improvement in every area. Assassin's Creed II feels like the true starting point for the series and the first game feels almost like a prequel. The developers seemed to listen to every complaint from the first game and put together a very solid package, the biggest change being variety. If you are new or a veteran of the series Assassin's Creed II is a game that everyone should enjoy.      Assassin's Creed II takes place directly after the events of the first game. After seeing subject 16's cryptic message on the wall Lucy breaks Desmond out of the Abstergo building and they find a hideout with two other Assassins, Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings, who have set up another Animus for Desmond to use. He needs to enter the Animus so they can find where the other Pieces of Eden are. The individual you get to control in the Animus this time around is Ezio Auditore, a young man in the late 1400s of Renaissance Italy. A close friend betrays his family, in turn Ezio is thrown into the life of an assassin hunting down those responsible for harming his loved ones. Over the course of several years that the game takes place Ezio discovers that there was more to their motives than meets the eye.      The story in this game is more refined and fleshed out than the original. There is a cast of many important, likeable (and unlikeable) characters this time around. Unlike the first game where there seemed to be a lot of time outside of the Animus the majority of Assassin's Creed II is spent inside the Animus which helps keep the story and direction of the game focused. The main character, Ezio, is a lot more charismatic than Altair who seemed to have a colder attitude. As a result you've got a game that is serious when it needs to and humorous and lighthearted other times.      The biggest improvement to the game is in the gameplay department. In the first game you were limited to doing repetitive and tedious tasks in order to unearth your assassination target. In the sequel your assassination targets are all related to the story so you won't be doing the same thing over and over. In fact in this one you don't even need to collect intel because each mission draws you closer to the assassination through the story. The side missions of the first game are still there but they are optional this time around. You can do random assassinations, races, pick pocket, and beat up missions any time you choose. Doing these missions no longer help you perform assassinations they just give you money.      Currency plays a big part in this game. There are a lot of ways to gain money. You can now pick pocket people at will. You can loot dead bodies. You can search for various treasure chests around the city. You get money for completing story missions and side missions. Then you can spend your money on a variety of things, all of them tie into several large gameplay elements introduced to this game.        One element is factions. There are three factions in this game that you can hire. Two are non violent courtesans and thieves. You can hire these people to distract guards allowing you to go places undetected like a true assassin. The third faction are warriors who will help you attack guards, this will eliminate guards to get to what you want although it will bring a lot of attention to you.        Also new to the game are shops. You can buy weapons and repair Ezio's armor. You can dye his clothes and you can buy treasure maps to help you find treasure and paintings that improve the value of your stronghold.      The stronghold is another new element in the game. The stronghold is your base of operations, a bit run down, but functional. You can spend your money to improve the stronghold in turn you can get discounts at shops and improve the value of your stronghold. The more money your stronghold is worth the more money that you can collect from it. Upgrade this and money that isn't really that hard to come by in the first place is even less hard to come by.      Like in the first game there are various things to collect, however, this time around you are rewarded for collecting items. In the first game you collected Assassin Flags and hunted down Templars. This didn't do anything for you. In the second game there are a couple of things you can collect that reward you. You can collect feathers for your mother, when you collect 100 you get something and collecting feathers also adds to your stronghold's value. There are treasure chests in each town. You don't get anything for finding them all but every chest you find gives you money. There are also hidden glyphs in the various cities. You find these by using your eagle vision. They are clues left by subject 16 each one brings you one step closer to finding out about “The Truth”. Various codex pages are hidden throughout the city and they are guarded. In order to get inside you'll have to take care of the guards (violently or non violently). The codex pages improve Ezio's health and also upgrade some of his weapons. There are also Assassin's Tombs to raid in the various cities. In these tombs the game plays more like Tomb Raider than it does Assassin's Creed. You enter them to find assassin seals, when you find them all you also unlock something special.      The controls for the most part have stayed the same. The biggest change to the game is the weapon wheel which allows you to quickly select from a variety of different items. You can now fight unarmed which allows you to disarm foes and use their own weapons against them. You can also carry bodies and hide them. There are smoke bombs and guns as well as the ability to throw money on the ground to distract guards and those pesky minstrels that always seem to get in your way.      Gone is the ability to blend at will with the A button. Instead this fast walks. Fast walking allows you to do a couple of things. You can walk fast to sneak up on a guard, they now can hear you if you're running. You can also fast walk into people and this allows you to steal their money. You can still blend in the game but you have to find a group of people. You can blend in with anyone but guards. Blending is most useful for when your notoriety meter is maxed out.      The developers introduced a notoriety system. A meter rises the more high profile assassinations you perform (among other actions). Guards will become suspicious at the sight of you when it's maxed out. To lower the meter you can tear down wanted posters, bribe heralds or assassinate corrupt officials. With all these gameplay tweaks and changes the game feels completely different and fresh and undoubtedly better than the first game.      The graphics in the first game were great even till this day. The graphics in the second game are even better than that. The characters are more detailed. They have faces and have emotions. They look a bit cartoony in comparison to the first game, but it is a reasonable sacrifice for the extra detail they bring to the game. The framerate is smoother than the first game and the textures are much improved, though this could also be by virtue of the game taking place in Italy instead of the middle east. The game now has a night and day cycle and the cities are bigger. They axed the kingdom environment of the first game, a massive environment that was between the three cities in the first game, and instead focused on larger cities and environments around the cities. It was nice in the first game but is not missed in the second game as there really is no reason to have such an environment. The biggest disappointment in an otherwise solid graphical performance are the boat effects. The rowing looks off and the boat looks like it is sliding across the top of the water and does not to appear be floating in the water. Other than that it is a graphically solid game.      With all these improvements it's not hard to make a case that the game is better than the first. The gameplay tweaks are just what this series needed. The game now has variety and is more focused. If you enjoyed the first game you will definitely enjoy this game. If you didn't enjoy the first game you may enjoy this game. It depends on what you didn't like. At it's core Assassin's Creed is still about making assassinations. The core is as solid as ever but now the mantle and crust are worth digging through to get there.]]>"

Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 2 is the sequel to the beautiful but deeply flawed Assassin's Creed. You reprise the role of Desmond in the present day parts but Altair and the third crusade has been ditched for a new character and setting. You play as Ezio during the peak of the renaissance in Italy. This game needed to take the solid concepts and good parts of Assassin's Creed but address the issues of repetitive side missions, limited assassination methods for main targets and the inability to swim, and damn it fixes them all.    The story line in AC2 is far superior to Assassin's Creed. Instead of a simple quest from your order, this time you are on a vendetta to avenge your families deaths. However, what really pushes the story of AC2 is the strong characterisation and setting which works really well for the story. Ubisoft link historical events directly to their fiction in the game, adding a layer of plausibility to the game and use real historical figures like Rodrigo Borgia, Leonardo Da Vinci and Lorenzo De Medici. Ezio is a great character, and greatly changes during the timeline of the game. His interactions with friends and family seem realistic and are emotive. The level of writing and characterisation for Ezio are way ahead of what Altair had in AC1, and the mix of the series mythology into this makes the story all the stronger. The game spans some years courtesy of the animus as a story device, allowing the player to see the changes wrought in the world and story. Even the modern setting for Desmond's story has been improved with better characters and weaving his tale into Ezio's story. Its a truly involving tale that is greatly rewarding to play through. The cities are incredibleGraphically Assassin's Creed 2 is beautiful. The level of detail in the environments is stunning, especially considering the size and scope of the cities you travel to in the game. There is a beautifully rendered and historically accurate Venice, Florence and Forli. The characters themselves are highly detailed, from clothing and weapons to facial features all look great. You can see the ornation in blades and armour on characters. The animations for character movement is also fantastic, as they move realistically and as if they have a weight. As you scale buildings with Ezio his animations always look great and plausible, a truly impressive achievement.  The sound enhances the game experience. Period music is used throughout, creating a fantastic musical ambiance for the cities as you travel through them. The score is perfect for the emotional story scenes and really adds to the emotion and character driven stories impact. The character voicing is also in the driving seat here. Assassin's Creed 1 was blemished by constant North American accents on middle eastern characters, but not so in this game. Italian voice work for Ezio's parts really do improve the immersion of the game, and you can even play the game in Italian if you choose.  The solid gameplay of AC1 has been preserved here, but the repetitive side missions have been dumped and replaced with creative and fun side missions. The structure of the main quest missions has been massively improved and varied. Instead of the boring system of doing 3 repetitive side missions and then a linear assassination that dominated AC1, this time you effectively have a different assassination method for each major target. In a particularly memorable mission you use Da Vinci's flying machine to infiltrate a palace and to reach your target. Its a much more exciting and fun main quest and allows AC2 to reach its potential. No longer are you limited to swords and knives; Assassin’s Creed II presents you with a variety of ways to kill enemies, even if some of them aren’t very useful (pistols, poison daggers, etc.). In addition, battles now have much more strategy to them than before; enemy health is now displayed upon lock-on, and while fights can quickly decline into violent button mashing  affairs, there is a myriad of moves, each with their own specific purpose and strategy.Desmond and co are back and improvedAC2 is more prone to bugs and glitches than its predecessor.   AI anomalies and graphical flaws occur here, though very rarely. Its just noticible as they were absent from AC1. The free flow structure of the game and the ability to determine your own methods of carrying out your missions is a well worthy trade off for a few small glitches. The removal of annoying beggars and the addition of the ability to swim is a GODSEND for this game, and you can even use rivers as a means of escape from guards in pursuit of you. The presentation is perfect here, and the  Prince of Persia-esque tombs that unlock better armor and weapons are a nice addition to the game and allow Ubisoft to further increase the mythos of the series.Assassin's Creed 2 is a fantastic free roaming adventure with a great story line and improved game structure. The game is long, taking me around 16 hours to complete first time through. The game has successfully taken the good parts of its predecessor but fixed all the problems and improved nearly everything. The missions are exciting and varied, and the characters are interesting and the script brilliantly written. The combat has been improved by the addition of new weapons and strategies, and the cities are magnificent. An odd ending which may or may not satisfy you and a few glitches and odd AI behaviour are the only real negative points of this amazing game. Assassins Creed had achieved its potential in this game.Ezio is a dangerous manPros:Involving story and excellent scriptImmersive atmosphere Historically accurate citiesBeautiful musical score Graphics are stunningEvery building is climbable Mission structure has been varied and hugely improvedDeep mythos which smartly interacts with real historical eventsCons:Ending may not sit well with everyoneSome odd AI behaviour and glitchesControls can sometimes cause problemsTemples could have been done betterWtf:One hand blade wasn't enough for Ezio Score: 9/10Beautiful game with great mechanics and a strong story. If the controls were slightly improved it would be even better.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[I wasn't terribly fond of the first Assassin's Creed. Well, let me put it this way: The first hour of Assassin's Creed 1 is near perfect. The mission takes a long time (which I personally love), it's really fun to ride your horse and the end of the first outing is very satisfying. Sadly, the rest of AC1 is EXACTLY THE SAME! Nothing changes. NOT A FRIGGIN' THING. I wanted to like that game so very much but I just couldn't do it. So repetitive it just makes you want to scream. AC1 could've been so good. It's not. However, the one bright spot was that Altair (the main character in the Animus) was awesome. He was a great character and had a great story.Assassin's Creed 2 has no Altair. Sadly, we get Ezio, the new main character, who's about as annoying as getting a car alarm installed in your brain. Maybe it's his voice actor? Maybe it's because I find him a whiny brat? Maybe it's because I fell he has no reason being an assassin? However, it's probably because I felt Altair was such a bad ass and thought to myself, 'why change it?'. Oh well, enough whining myself. AC2 is actually a really well done video game.The Positives:The game is gorgeous and the story is really fun and engaging.The city's are alive and vibrant and there is always a ton to do inside each one.I really enjoy that you don't have to ride a horse everywhere, too.The fights are ultimately satisfying with improved controls and nothing beats the countering system which is a blast to do.The Negatives:It seems the problems that plagued the first game with climbing are present here. I was constantly missing ladders and ledges and falling to my death. If you miss it by an inch, then you miss it totally. No forgiveness.Oh yeah, and Ezio sucks.However, it's a solid game that looks great and, despite some hiccups in the climbing, it's a blast. I hear AC:Brotherhood is awesome. Can't wait to play it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The first Assassin's Creed ended with all the enigmatic hints at story direction that a conspiracy nut could ever hope for. Being partial to the odd secret history tale myself, I entered AC2 on a wave of anticipation of where the story may go. I also entered with certain reservations about the game play of the previous game and much of my expectations were based on seeing whether the game design issues of the previous title were addressed while keeping up the effective story telling of its predecessor.An hour or two into AC2, it becomes evident that not many of the core mechanics of the game have changed. The developers instead attempted to break up the repetitive missions of the first game by building out the meta-game. There is always something to collect (paintings, weapons, feathers, video-clips) and some side-objective (assassination, race, fisticuffs) to complete, and if you are willing to let the game lead you by the nose you will get some mileage out of it. Your enjoyment of the game's many side-objectives will depend on your enjoyment of the core free-running, combat, and stealth mechanics as they are repeated in order to collect the goodies on offer.Of the game-play mechanics, combat has received most of the attention. Different enemy types requiring different strategies to defeat. Fights are also typically larger in scale and I had less of a feeling that the AI was happily waiting to be killed off by counterattack after counterattack. Some exploitative strategies are still possible, but at least this sequel succeeds in not letting the player autopilot through combat encounters.Stealth mechanics received less attention although the new protagonist, Ezio, is able to blend with a greater variety of crowds than (monk-groupie) Altair and direct allied groups (courtesans, thieves, mercenaries) to distract guards with varying levels of aggression. The AI unfortunately still creates some rather ridiculous scenarios wherein the player can be spotted on the top of a highly secure castle, break line of sight with a guard, and be forever forgotten. Renaissance era guards were apparently more fixated on the view than the flamboyantly dressed assassin attempting to gut their employer.Ubisoft clearly attempted to one up the Altair character model, with something that would look more eye catching as a collectible figurine. The problem with this of course is that nothing sticks out more in AC2's game world than its protagonist ""blending in"". Another aspect where I felt the developer overreached, which ultimately coloured my enjoyment of the game, was the game's plot. I enjoyed the story far more when it was withholding its secrets from me than when it ultimately revealed what they were.Ultimately, AC2 is a competent action adventure game that employs the same ""RPG"" game-play tropes as many of its contemporaries in an attempt to keep the player engaged. To its credit the story missions are more enjoyable and a player ploughing straight through should be in for a good romp. What will ultimately determine a player's enjoyment of the game however, are their feelings towards the story. Mine were as such that I'm putting this franchise on the backburner for a while.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[The first Assassins' Creed was one of the most ambitious games ever made. The combination of unique settings, open-world exploration, cutting edge technology, and stealth/action gameplay made for an experience that was mind-blowing, at times. At the same time, the game was so rife with copy-and-paste design that, at times, it felt like a glorified tech demo with some elements tacked on so that it could be called a ""game"". The game received glowing reviews at release, but it is not viewed as favorably looking back. Assassins' Creed 2 is an excellent game that addresses almost every flaw in the first game. It replaces a lot of the copy-and-paste design from the first game with more effort put into each individual area and mission. At the same time, it expands the series by adding new gameplay elements. Assassins Creed 2 is one of the most ambitious and well-designed games to come out in the past five years, and anyone who enjoys action games should play it.Ubisoft had a lot to work with when they started this game. The technology is amazing, and the basic mechanics in the first game worked really well. This is especially true of the open-ended parkour style exploration. Thanks to a great control system and a lot of terrific animations, climbing buildings and running across rooftops was smooth, easy, and often breathtaking. These elements are all still in place, and just as great as before. When it comes to exploring a city on foot, there is still no other series that comes close to this one. Acrobatically speeding across a half mile of rooftops is a little piece of gameplay that never gets old. The view of a grand city from the top of a 200-foot building that only you can climb never fails to amaze.Where Assassins' Creed 2 deviates from its predecessor most strongly is in its mission design. Gone is the endless rotation of the same three or four generic mission types. In its place is a very long series of unique story-related missions, along with a huge collection of quality side missions. There is an entirely different feel to this sequel – so much that it hardly seems like the same studio designed it. It doesn't feel, at all, like a tech demo. It feels like a real world, just like the worlds in the Grand Theft Auto series or Piranha Bytes RPGs like Risen. When you pull off a mission, and there are some good ones, you feel like you are legitimately advancing the storyline.The story missions are really good, and so are the side missions. You get freelance assassinations for money, which provide you with some interesting twists as you progress through them. There is also a small set of indoor treasure hunts through some elaborately designed areas. These areas don't include a lot of enemies, but they contain more puzzles and Prince of Persia style platforming. These optional hunts are just a small portion of the game, but they provide you with a couple of quality hours of gameplay and a big reward if you complete them all. The best, and most bizarre of the side items is a game-long quest that you receive to find a series of runes hidden on buildings. When you find them, you get a puzzle to solve, and when you solve it, you unlock a short video clip. When you unlock them all, they combine to form a crazy short video called ""The Truth"". It's a fantastic reward for a very fun scavenger hunt. The first game had nothing remotely like this. Most games don't.In addition to the gameplay, Assassins' Creed 2 provides a more varied look than the first game. Specifically, the major areas in the game look different from one another. There are unique, actual buildings in the cities that are fun to look at and climb. Along with them comes a codex that gives you all kinds of background material on them and some of the game's famous historical figures, if you care to read them. The campaign here is about as packed with quality content as any game in recent memory.Assassins Creed 2 doesn't just do a great job of putting the elements from the original game to work. It also expands on the gameplay in a couple of meaningful ways. Some of them work better than others, but none of them are bad. The best improvement is an upgrade to your stealth abilities. Ezio, the protagonist in this game, has more tools at his disposal than Altair for staying hidden. There are a couple of ways that you can distract guards, like hiring a pack of hookers to flirt with them, or thugs to pick a fight with them. You can blend in with crowds more than you could in the first game if you need to lose pursuers or sneak up on somebody. In addition, you have some additional tools that you can use, like poison. Assassins' Creed 2 feels exactly like the assassination game that it was always meant to be. It's fun to stalk a target, plotting how you can sneak in close unseen or lure his guards away with a distraction.The combat has been upgraded since the first game, as well. This was absolutely necessary, as probably even the most hardcore fans of the first game were sick of the combat by the end. Assassins' Creed 2's uses the same basic principles, but it provides a wider variety of enemies, and it is more challenging. Blocking and countering still rules the day, and button mashing is worthless. Armored enemies no longer go down with just one successful counter. You have to beat them up a little bit first. Disarming has been added to help you through some of these encounters, as well as a one hit kill pistol. Combat is better, although by the end of the game, you will probably be at least a little bit tired of it. Even with the improvements, there is still too much combat in this game, and there still aren't more than a few kinds of enemies. A big challenge for Assassins' Creed 3 and beyond will be to make more improvements in this area.Assassins' Creed 2 is a very complex game. In addition to improved stealth and combat, it also adds some RPG-like gold management to the picture. You now earn money for your assassinations, and you can buy maps that will lead you to treasure chests all about the city. This part of the game doesn't work quite as well. There isn't a whole lot to buy with your money besides better weapons, armor, or collectibles that don't have any in-game impact. You get a home base in this game that you can upgrade and decorate, but there doesn't seem to be much of a point. The treasure chests are scattered in abundance around the city, usually just sitting unguarded for no reason in particular. Since you mostly need money for 100% completion and it's not particularly fun to scavenge for it, this is another area of the game that could have used some improvement.This game will take you a long time to finish, and a big reason that you will want to stick with it is because of the storyline. The main story is of a young man, Ezio Auditore, growing from a playboy to a seasoned assassin while defending his family from a grand conspiracy. He is a very likeable character, and so are his family and friends. The game succeeds easily at getting you to care about their fates, andgetting you angry and the family's enemies. The background story is the modern day war of the Templars vs Assassins, with Desmond controlling Ezio via the Animus. The two stories come together with a huge unexpected twist at the end that is one of the greatest ""whoa"" moments in gaming history.I can't quite say that Assassins' Creed 2 thrives because it focuses on quality instead of quantity, because the game has tons of both. It is, for the most part, a masterpiece of a game and everything that a sequel should be. It's flaws are limited to things that get sort of monotonous after you have played the game for 20 hours, but it takes a special action game to suck you in long enough to notice. If you were put off from playing this game because you got bored with the first game, or because of Ubisoft's controversial copy protection scheme, then I highly recommend that you put those reservations aside and play the game. This combination of stealth, exploration, and adventure gaming should not be missed.]]>"

The point is, ACII took everything that was good about ACI and expanded upon it, making it bigger, better, faster, stronger, and more Italian. It blew Part One out of the water and entrenched us deeper in the most engrossing plot in video game history (at least from MY kooky perspective). Venice and Florence = Gorgeous. 'Nuff said.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Okay so if you've read my review of Assassin's Creed I concluded it wanted to be a triple A game but didn't have the budget for it. Assassin's Creed 2 clearly had the budget because they went for AAA status and earn it. Ezio's costume compared to Altair's is analogous to the first and second games. Where Altair's costume is very plain and functional, Ezio's has all the frills and detail, plus MORE BLADES.There's no need for me to talk about everything with this game, just go look at my review for the previous game and add a lot of fixes to bugs (still there but actually very minimal and doesn't affect the overall game). The combat system has been improved and the story is excellent. Altair was a badass but it was hard to empathise with him, you see this new Ezio character evolve and the game is better for it. You see his drive and motivations, plus he's got more personality. The whole Desmond meta-story is still there, it's fine in fact I'd say it's better executed here. But still the best thing about the Desmond story is Nolan North's voice. Voice acting on the whole is very good, as is the sound. Graphics are a big step up from the first game, they really have the polish of a tentpole game.The problem with sequels is people want more of the same from the previous game but if you don't innovate then you run the risk of it being boring. AC2 straddles this quandary very well, adding new skills, mini games and techniques to spice things up. I mentioned the combat system being improved and that's on the innovations I mentioned. The problem is, combat in Assassin's Creed games can be broken down to block and mash counter attack. You can near enough win every brawl in all the games with this method. I'm speaking from the point of view having played most of the games and looking back I'm thinking AC2 was the point where ubisoft could have broken the mould on it's combat system. Instead they've backed themselves into the situation I mentioned above, in that if they were to make radical changes the audience who are looking for more of the same would be turned off. The problem now is it's the same and get's tedious. It's a shame they didn't take the risk in AC2.The Assassin's Creed games are popcorn games, you're there to enjoy the story, get invested in the characters and have some fun while doing it. And this game has it all, I feel it's the best of the series. Yes the following games will stand as better side by side, this game though was such a big step up from the first and really made the franchise (ugh I feel dirty saying that word). Ezio steals the show and it's a real fun ride, especially when you're free running...god I love free running.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed II is one of the games I've been meaning to buy and play for a year or three. As such, there are many descriptive reviews already written. My review will be very basic.I originally played the first Assassin’s Creed on Xbox 360 when I trialed Gamefly years ago. I beat the game in a week and returned it. It was really fun and not too long. I knew I’d want to play the sequel.I played Assassin's Creed II on my PC using an Xbox 360 controller. It's one of those games that should be played with a controller in my opinion, although I never even tried the keyboard and mouse. Using the controller worked very well. The only annoying action was changing your weapon using the weapon wheel. Pretty much every time I did, the cursor would pass over the weapon I wanted and land on the next one. When I tried to correct it, it would fly back two places, again missing the weapon I desired.Assassin’s Creed II was too long for me. I thought the production of the game was excellent. It’s a top quality game. There are several activities you can do to play even longer than I did. I believe I spent nearly 30 hours to complete the game. I skipped many of the optional missions (aka memories). Still, I was expecting it to be around eight hours like the first one. To me, the length was a disappointment. To others, it was probably wonderful.In summary, I’m scoring the game with 4/5 stars. I’d give it five had it been closer to ten hours. It would have been short and very sweet, making me want to play the next one. Instead, I don’t plan on buying other games in the series. I can’t give it any less than four stars, because I think the production quality of the game is top notch.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[SPOILERS I will put another Spoiler warning before the actual spoilers. So, my last review was of Assassin's Creed. Great game, but had its fair share of problems. So lets review its sequel! Assassins Creed Part Deux.The game starts off literately right where the first one ended. You get a quick recap of the previous game and then your off! Time to escape Abstergo with Desmond and Lucy. Ah Desmond. You were an interesting plot twist in the first one. Now you are just preventing me from stabbing dudes. No fear, because he eventually actually DOES get to stab dudes! But not right now. HAHAHA!Lucy was an Assassin all along and now she is helping you escape from the Templar run Abstergo Industries. To speed things up, basically, you escape, meet a couple new people, and get hooked into the Animus 2.0. This new one lets you stay in it much longer, so that way you can...be in the interesting part of the story much longer. The reason you're in the Animus in this one, is so that by playing as your Ancestor Ezio Auditore, you can learn from him by way of the Bleeding Effect.The story is already much improved from the first one. You don't get pulled out of the Animus as often, and therefore, the metastory is less intrusive of the interesting story.For most of the game you play as Ezio Auditore, an assassin during the Renaissance. Ah, but this time he doesn't start out as an Assassin. You start the game at his birth, and go along with his life as it happens. This makes for a much more compelling character ark for Ezio compared to Altiar. You see Ezio's life, you live it, you spend time with his family, his friends. So when you get down to the mystery of the story, you really WANT Ezio to get to the bottom of the betrayal. It also may be because Ezio has a personality. He is a fun-loving, wise cracking playboy. But he grows throughout the game, but never loses his personality. It makes for a much more fun character to play as.The only problems I really have with the story is part of the conspiracy aspect. As you go through the game, you start knocking off people on your list, connected to the conspiracy. Then when you are down to the last person, suddenly more people are added to the list. Its not very rewarding, but it does have a story purpose, so I can't really hate the game for it.The other is the ending. Talk about a disappointment. SPOILER SPOILER You fucking invade the Vatican! YES! SWEET! Once the bad guy was revealed as Rodrigo Borgia, any history buff knew where this was heading. A goddamn battle with the most corrupt pope in history. And you finally, FINALLY, get to use the Apple of Eden. Suddenly you have five Ezio's helping you attack Rodrigo. Which basically amounts to, keep stabbing so he can't stab back. What the fuck? Then you go down into the Vault, and its going to be a good ol' one on one fist fight. An epic conclusion no? Just keep on punching and he can't hit back...Now for the actual cliffhanger ending of Ezio's story was a disappointment as well. Okay now we can get to everything else. Is it me or are the graphics worse then Assassin's Creed? Seriously, everything is muddier. The faces are also terrifying. Seriously. Its not a severe detractor to the game though.Now the gameplay. The combat is a little different from the first game. Because now counters are even more overpowered. Yay. The real meat of the gameplay is in the openworld. This is one of the best open worlds in gaming history. Exploring Venice and other places are just fantastic. There are soooo many things to do and see! And I never once felt like I needed to do any of it! From exploring Assassin tombs, to doing Assassination Contracts, all of it was fun, and never really frustrating. From upgrading Monterigonni, to collecting Feathers. I will always remember how fun this game was. There is a wide variety of things to see and do, and you will never be bored by the end of the game.Assassin's Creed 2 is a fantastic game, and still has yet to be bested by the newer releases in the series.5/5]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[This is no simple sequel. This is Assassin's Creed II. Released in 2009 for consoles and in 2010 for PC, AC2 quickly gained a TON of critical acclaim, and for good reason, too. This game improves upon virtually every element that fell short in AC1 and makes all of the first games good points better.]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[Released in 2009 and developed by Ubisoft Montreal, Assassin’s Creed II is a unique and compelling adventure through renaissance Italy, placing the protagonist at the front lines of history in a way that no game has ever done prior. It expands on the foundation laid down by its predecessor, improving on many different mechanics while remaining faithful to the formula. In this way, Assassin’s Creed II signifies what makes a true sequel, and does it exceptionally well. It certainly has a few loose wires in its system, but nothing that keeps it from being a wonderful experience that should not be missed.The story of Assassin’s Creed II continues along the same threads sown in the previous game, with Desmond Miles being held hostage by the mega-corporation known as Abstergo Industries (A.K.A. The Templars) and forced into a machine called the Animus to relive the memories of a particular ancestor. Only now, he is rescued and taken to an Assassin safe-house in modern-day Italy.Badass? Badass.Thus, into another Animus he goes, this time reliving the memories of Ezio Auditore, a young and charismatic Italian ladies man with a hint of arrogance. Ezio has a knack for getting into trouble, and it is clear that he still has a lot of maturing to do. This lighthearted persona makes him a very likable protagonist, and in turn, leads to certain meaningful narrative moments. Ezios life is turned on its head after a deadly betrayal by the Templars leaves most of his family dead, and the rest on the run. Ezio dons the hood, and wields the blade, and goes on a quest across Italy seeking revenge on those Templars responsible for the death of his family, and discovers a conspiracy that will change his life forever.The narrative of Assassin’s Creed II is captivating, and keeps an excellent pace throughout, never moving too hastily or too leisurely. And it is lengthy, easily clocking in at 30+ hours worth of gameplay. Keeping that narrative moving along is a large cast of diverse characters, from master thieves to brute warriors, from politicians to corrupt officials, there is plenty of personality.Then, of course, there are the Templars. These cunning conspirators aim to control all of Italy through political rule…. and they will achieve this by force it they must. Clearly, Ezio has his hands full plotting assassinations, some of which are diverse enough to stay entertaining.Most of the missions are unique and varied.Some. Not all. While Assassin’s Creed II finds strength in its many assassinations, this is also where one of its most significant weaknesses lies. It can sometimes feel like there are TOO many Templars, which leads to an unpleasant sense of repetition that is reminiscent of the first game. A little more focus on just a few Templars would have been more effective.Luckily though, the game saves itself from being as repetitious as its predecessor by having a far more diverse mission design. Rather than following a linear and predictable path, it instead takes a more direct narrative-driven approach, with each mission being unique, with its own objectives and conditions.The actual gameplay is more fluid, especially in the parkour. Ezio is quite agile, and the act of climbing and jumping around along the rooftops is gratifying. The combat is basically the same as in the first game, remaining very counter-based and generally quite simple. It is somewhat more fluid, but not much different than that. Ezios arsenal consists of familiar weaponry such as hidden wrist-blades, a sword and dagger, and new weapons such as poison, smoke bombs and a hidden pistol.There is also a wealth of optional missions to delve into, the most rewarding of which are Assassin Tombs. There are six of these platforming missions, and the completion of each one rewards you with a key, and upon finding all six keys, Ezio unlocks the armor and sword of Altair. There are also Assassination Contracts, where you are assigned a target to eliminate. These two optional mission types are very fun and satisfying to complete. Viewpoints also return, but they are not as necessary to progress as they were in the first game. There are also collectible items scattered across the cities.Additionally, there are some oddly misplaced side-activities, such as Beat-Up events (which require you to beat up an unfaithful husband), Courier Assignments, and Races. These latter three could have been much better, but unfortunately, most of them are poorly designed and mundane, which detracts a bit from the side-content.Exploring ancient Assassin Tombs is gratifying.Using the new economy system, Ezio can go to shops to buy new weapons, armors and miscellaneous supplies. Additionally, different colors are available to purchase for your assassin robes. Money can be gained by completing missions, finding treasure chests, and by gaining income from Ezios villa. By renovating buildings in the villa, income is received over time, and it certainly adds up.The cities of Assassin’s Creed II are simply magnificent, with art direction and atmosphere that even trumps that of the first game. There are a few different locations, such as the cities of Florence and Venice, and the towns and countrysides of San Gimignano and Forli. These locations are incredibly distinct from one another, with the majestic architecture of Venice, the vineyards of the countryside, and the soiled streets of Forli, the rendition of Italy in Assassin’s Creed II is truly gorgeous. The detail that goes into these environments makes the parkour even more enjoyable.Just like it’s predecessor, Assassin’s Creed II achieves excellent atmosphere through its soundtrack, with what I believe is one of the best ever composed. The harmonic, serene tones and smooth, Italian-inspired vocal delivery are a pleasure to hear, and act as a crucial part of setting some of the best atmospheric ambiance I have ever experienced.The VerdictTake a leap of faith.Assassin’s Creed II is an inspiring success as a sequel, improving and expanding on nearly every aspect and mechanic of the first game, and adding plenty of new and meaningful features into a wonderful mix. It does this with an excellent story with plenty of characters, a good economic system, improved gameplay, a good amount of worthy optional-missions, fantastic cities and atmosphere, and a superb soundtrack. It does have some snags, such as slightly repetitious assassinations, some poorly designed side-activities, and combat that has remained clunky. But fortunately, the experience is not overwhelmingly hindered by those blights. Assassin’s Creed II is one of the most inspiring game experiences of its time, and Ezios quest for vengeance is one that you will not regret taking part in.The Positive+ Splendid story with plenty of characters+ Various new and useful features and improvements+ Most of the side missions are gratifying+ Ambient cities and atmosphere+ Superb soundtrackThe Negative- Frequently repetitious assassinations- Some side-activities are poorly designed]]>"
Assassin's Creed II,"<![CDATA[ I cannot deny Assassin’s Creed 1 was my cup of tea. Sure, it had its problems, sure there were only a few different objectives after all, sure most people were interested because of the beautiful graphics. Still, controlling Altair in never-before-seen ancient middle-east was a wonder to behold. The whole stealth concept was done right, the parkour as well. It was not a brilliant game when we look back to it but had such differing factor upon everything we were used to at the time that I just could not resist.I cannot really blame people disliking it but as far as I can tell, I enjoyed that game immensely; played on both PC and Xbox 360. Since Ubisoft learned the do’s and don’ts after a successful first attempt it’s natural to expect a much better polished game, more varied missions and a continuation of the complex backbone story behind everything that sometimes feels a little overboard, I guess that’s what they were aiming for.Notably Ezio Auditore, the new protagonist, controls pretty much like Altair did, some tweaks can be noticed on how the buttons are bound but everything is customizable, so most of the time no problem whatsoever, just rebind the whole thing. There is one big letdown though, the quick selection for weapons. Some do not have the option to be bound to numbers, which leads to frustration having to rely on the button-wheel every time you need to use throwing knives for example. Those moments are often swift where you need to hit someone on the run, and not having a single button to press and equip is frustrating.It is debatable whether the rudimentary fire-weapon needed a quick button since it destroys stealth and takes too long to fire. The wide selection of weapons is nice, some dual-hand axes along with nifty short swords encompass Ezio’s arsenal. The combat system feels similar to what the first installment provided. Chain blows are golden while the defensive stance counter-attack move still rules, though slightly less effective than before.Strangely, the outer-world is much more compressed. The first AC threw the player into a sterile land with countless collectibles, while the next step should probably be the addition of purpose to those large areas of land, what you get is a long pathway that might be visited twice since fast travel is served with general abundance. Everything develops within classic Italian cities much like the first one did in the middle-east.The change of color hues in the original was what set apart Acre from Jerusalem, for example. In this continuation the cities offer more nuances between them. They’re not exactly apparent per say, but the player should notice as the game moves, especially when you learn that water is not a pit straight to hell to Ezio as it was to Altair. In addition, outskirts paint the sceneries of most locales, offering much more dynamism in exploration.There’s an area introduced early in the game that will be the headquarters, if we can call it that, to all assassin operations. The Villa starts out small-time. Struck with poverty, it stands as nothing more than a safe haven for someone wanted throughout the country. As you inject money it prospers and ultimately becomes your main source of income. By investing in the small town you will have access to better weaponry from the forger and other merchants, as larger quantities of money will flow through the place.As explained later in a nifty extended gameplay, The Villa was founded by the one first Auditore after changing his own name in order to seek avenging on the death of his wife and father, killed by Templars. The Templar organization is the main antagonist in AC, they have been craving for the powerful pieces of Eden in search of great power since hundreds of years past. The “actual” protagonist Desmond Miles who in the first AC was submitted to a strange machine called Animus, marks appearance as well. No more of those tedious interludes walking around the laboratory, thank the Gods.Assassin’s Creed has quite a complex story, Desmond Miles, now a fugitive, enters the Animus in a hideout after escaping with the mad doctor’s assistant, Lucy. This weird “off-the-book” Animus allows Desmond to revisit his ancestors’ memories by DNA processing. The moments controlling Desmond are brief, mainly to state that any skill gotten from memories will be kept intact in the present.The production value shows much better perspective. Although I loved the first one, I could not help but notice the robotic Altair portrayal. Everything seemed strangely out of place since Altair was constantly being outsmarted by anyone on the verge of dying. The linear nature of Ezio’s quest might have helped a lot.Along with Ezio the famous inventor and all-around know-it-all, Leonardo Da Vinci, marks a presence as a true assassin helper. His superior intellect will come in handy when Ezio finds the need to understand encrypted tomes. The dialogs between the two friends are surprisingly well-written, from the moment they meet to several years past, their relationship deepens and the player gets to watch it all.If AC1 did not do much and ended up boring you out from repetitive quests do not expect this to be any different. To tell the truth, it surprises me to think people often cite AC2 as what AC1 should have been from the beginning. There is still not much more than going around killing whoever crosses your path, with eventual running quests and beating up of cheating husbands.Much of what could be called innovative comes from the amazing synergy between objectives and story. There is a lot going on, and it happened in a more meaningful flow this time around. The story is better told, better paced, better explained. The side characters fit better roles in the overall picture. Altair sought enlightenment, Ezio seeks revenge. Half his family is ordered dead when the Templars get to his father’s assassin roots. Ezio takes on the duty after seeing his father and two brothers hung by the neck for a trumped-up charge of treason.As always, the first thing to do is search for a high point within the city. From there you synchronize what you have learned and objectives will pop-up the screen. Some are secondary, some are quite essential to move the story. There is still quite a lot of synchronization to be done, while some started an uproar in the first for being a monotonous task, there is in all 73 towers, basilicas, churches, walls or whatever the case may be that large portions of land can be seen and analyzed.The gigantic amount of collectibles is still there. AC1 had hundreds of flags and Templars to kill. AC2 has feathers—which Ezio’s little brother adored, a sort of memento to ease the pain from his mother–and many paintings. The paintings only require money and can be bought in the different cities Ezio visits. The feathers are as the flags were, except fewer in number, 100 of them scattered around.There are hundreds of chests everywhere, finding them and keeping track is easier since one of the merchants sells maps that help the player. Every time one is opened, it disappears. That does not happen with feathers nor are the locations shown. For true exploration and desperation, a no-guide hunt is preferred. There is also the possibility of dyeing Ezio’s clothes to change the color, giving further personal taste to the everyday assassinations.Assassin’s Creed 2 is a definite step forward from its predecessor. Although I would severely argue on the matter of quest variance, there is no denying that it feels more cohese with the story, with a higher polish rate. While there is a higher chance that anyone who disliked the first one might change their mind, I still think fans of the original will have a better time with it. The changes made are possibly enough to justify another try, though keep in mind they are not so massive and one might expect.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to most will seem like a cash-in for Ubisoft to some, a multi-player experiment to others.  At the end of the day, Brotherhood offers a lengthy, quality single-player experience much like it's predecessor before it, and a unique multi-player mode with a progression system similar to systems found in ""other"" games.   Brotherhood starts of right after the end of Assassin's Creed II.   The protagonist also returns from the second game in the franchise, Ezio Auditore.   *Spoiler* The tale  begins right after Ezio uncovered the vault in the Vatican church, and has players escaping from Rome seconds after the end of ACII.  Events arise, forcing the player to play the majority of the game in Rome, where the story unfolds similar to the mission progression in ACII, with some slight changes and adjustments due it being just one big city this time around.  The game begins slow, letting players get used the city improvement mechanics, the Borgia towers, and the faction building.  Eventually, players will have to recruit, manage, and control new assassin's send them out to missions, or even have them aid them in battle.  It is quite satisfying to see a fellow assassin jump from the sky, out of nowhere, to assassinate a target much like the player is encouraged to do throughout the Assassin's Creed franchise.   The game also includes more collectibles such as feathers as well as Borgia flags to find throughout the city of Rome, allowing for plenty of exploration.  When in Eagle Eye mode, feathers and flags can be tagged and appear on the map if players wish to revisit and find what they missed.   The story not only continues Ezio's tale, but Desmond's as well.  In Brotherhood, players will get to control Desmond anytime they wish, and are allowed to leave the animus any time they want to test Desmond's parkour abilities, read e-mails (if you remember reading e-mails in the first Assassin's Creed game you'll know what to expect).    Finally, along with the quality single-player this game has to offer, a unique and addictive multi-player mode is also included in the package.  The entire multi-player portion of the game is tied to the core universe, so it doesn't feel unwanted but happily welcomed to the franchise.  The multi-player offers three core modes to jump in to, but they all focus around hunting for and hiding from.  The whole idea of ""social stealth"" works great with multi-player, and the experience is something that just can't be explained but must be experienced.  The three game modes include Wanted, Manhunt, and Alliance.  Wanted is the game's answer to Free-for-All, every man for himself, and the world is filled with 7 other players along with hundreds of NPC's.  The other modes are interesting as well, but Wanted seems like the game mode players will keep coming back to.  The thrill is not knowing who is or isn't after you, and the mystery of who your real target is, all happening at the same time is an intense feeling.  Throughout the multi-player, players are rewarded by leveling up and unlocking new perks, abilities, weapons, etc. allowing them an assassins suited to their strengths. In terms of consoles, I have experienced a lot of screen tearing on the PS3 version, I can not confirm the quality of the Xbox 360 version. For $60, people really must ask themselves if how much they enjoyed Assassin's Creed II.  Most found ACII to be worth the money, and Brotherhood is essentially continuing and expanding the Assassin's Creed universe as well as bringing something new to the table with it's unique multi-player.  It is definitely worth experiencing, both the single-player and the multi-player, with just enough new content added to both sides for a game released a year after it's last outing. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I've been a fan of the AC series since the first game. So it was only natural for me to grab a copy of Brotherhood. Though what I got was kind of a mixed bag...  The game picked up literally seconds after the events of AC2. Desmond and company has hit the road after the Templars, while in the Animus, Ezio has confronted his nemesis and discovered the secret hidden beneath the Vatican and must escape. Returning players from AC2 will pick up immediately on where the plot picks up. However, newcomers will feel largely in the dark as Brotherhood draws heavily on elements established in the previous title. Personally though, as a fan who has played the previous games, it's nice not to have a ham handed rehash of what I already knew.  In the same regard the game mechanics previously established are back, with some minor new flourishes and features. You'll still be climbing through the game, the general area being Rome, stalking and taking out your foes. New additions to the combat is an Execution maneuver that allows for continuous killing blows afters successfully countering an attack. The killing blows have also been flared up to incorporate Ezio's hidden pistol, but this is largely for show.  One of the big new features is the ability to recruit and train assassins to join your ranks. The number of recruits is based on the number of Borgia towers you destroy, thus freeing up areas of Rome from their control. Once recruited you can use your assassins to aid you in combat or send them on missions in the greater European area to earn money and experience to rank up your recruits until they officially pledge themselves to the Creed.  Sadly though, this feature largely fades into the background, despite Brotherhood being in the title. After the initial introductory mission they play no part in the overall plot and due to the odd circumstances in which it requires to even check the status of your recruits; the whole feature feels disconnected from the game.  Perhaps my most major gripe is the odd tweaks done to the controls since AC2. For some reason the controls in Brotherhood feel overly sensitive to the point that free-climbing can be twitchy and more often then not you'll be jumping in a direction you never meant to travel. At first I thought it was just me but my room mate, who also played AC2, found similar frustration right from the start. But this is hardly my only complaint.  Overall the game feels average, like an expansion that's getting way too much hype. The story, both Desmond's and Ezio's, feels like it could have been summed up in the first 20 or 30 minutes of AC3, rather then needing a whole separate game. Sadly Ezio's character is showing some holes. We've seen his rise from careless young noble to grizzled assassin. What's left is largely flat and at times inconsistent for plot sake. Equally Desmond is still pretty much silently following Lucy and her team and other then making snarky comments here and there, doesn't make any growth in Brotherhood. The supporting cast of characters are also not as fleshed out as they could have been. Targets Ezio hunts largely just appear just so he has someone to kill, rather then giving us a good background and understanding why we need to kill them. The only exception perhaps being Caesar Borgia, who steals the show whenever he's present.  The new additions quickly get uninteresting after receiving them. Coupled with some choices that may seem pointless, you might feel ripped off. Like, remember the poison in AC2? Yea, I used it maybe once and the results were nothing grand. Well guess what? Now you can shoot the poison needle at targets... Yay?  I should also mention the new multiplayer game, seeing as that's the only thing Ubisoft seemed to market Brotherhood for. I played it on the release day so things may have changed, just bare that in mind.   The setup for the multiplayer is the Templars are using the Animus to train their operatives in the skills of the assassins. That's just the explanation behind it and we have no idea if that hints to elements for AC3. Anyway, trying to join a match proved to be a lengthy endeavor as the online community was sparse. Though I did get into a few games. The basic mechanics are just the like single player game. Only rather then hunt npcs, you hunt other players. Points are awarded for kills, the more stealthy and skilled the kill, the more points are earned. The game does a good job at encouraging a cat and mouse style of play. The points earned go towards leveling you up, unlocking new abilities and gear to aid in your online matches.  Unfortunately, while the game encourages using the stealth mechanics, it doesn't prevent players from throwing all that away. My experience was largely hunting other players who spent the majority of each round running on the roof tops. Sure it made them easy to spot but given we're all at the same speed and climbing abilities it made getting close enough to kill them downright impossible. This was compounded by the players hunting me actually using subtly and scoring major points each time they got me.  I also encountered a bug that was nearly game breaking. In Free For All mode after you kill your assigned target, or you lose your current target for whatever reason, the game was unable to acquire me another one. I let it sit for nearly an entire match, which lasts around 10 minutes, and it never gave me one. All the while other players could hunt me. SO I basically became score padding for others and unable to land kills myself. Though I haven't played the multiplayer since then so it may have been fixed. There are other team based modes to play but from what I've seen they largely boil down to FFA matches with restrictions. Especially since there are no new controls to aid your teammates.  Finishing this review up, finally, I have to give Brotherhood a lower rating then I would have liked. I mean I still love the series and the standards established are still present. The artwork and level designs are great and the voice work with a killer music score is still a joy. Unfortunately the odd, and buggy, tweaks to the controls and lack luster additions can't be shadowed by what the game does well.  I can only suggest renting it if you're on the fence. I'm simply hoping AC3 reignites my love for the franchise to full blast again.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[  It has only been a year since the last Assassin title and know with a large emphasis on team mates and multiplayer is there enough to make this a must buy on your holiday list or is it just a quick cash in.       This game’s is a continuation of Ezio’s story, starting off with a quick recap of the first two games and then quickly getting back into the game play by starting just before the final cut scene in the second game ends. While they do a job of getting the overall idea of the game it will be easier to understand for those that are caught up with the entire story. After a great confusion of what to do after finishing his long quest Ezio decides to go home believing that his work is finally done but sadly that is not the case, with his villa under attack from Caesar’s Army and after doing everything you could, all that you worked so hard on in the second game are destroyed and to video game fashion during this you lose all of your money and equipment. After a terrible voyage you find yourself in Rome and with nothing but the devastation of what happened to your home only vengeance is running through Ezio’s mind.        When this game was first announced it was an intriguing idea to bring a co-op idea into the fast and intricate fighting style of this game. Along the way you will run into people that you can help and in turn they will work for you doing assignments all over the country earning you money and they experience. While there not running across the land you can call upon them to fight your enemies so you stay hidden or when there is just too many of them. They work magnificently, one call and from the top of buildings or behind ruins they will get rid of your targets and as fast as they got there they leave like true assassins. However while this is a good way to stay hidden it’s not really needed for any other reason than gaining more cash, fighting in this game is easier than the previous ones (if that is possible). Like before even if you’re completely surrounded enemies will wait and go one at a time so you can counter kill them, now when you get a kill you can go into a kill streak where ever enemy will die in a single hit and will never block making huge assaults a cake walk. Very quickly you are able to gain new items and weapons but outside of the hidden blade I doubt you will be using much of anything else, only on the fact that there is just no reason to. Other than that the rest of the game play hasn’t changed at all, which is good, why change what isn’t exactly broken.       Like the previous games the landscape is vast and just getting to the next mission or finding optional side quests can take quite a bit of time, and while that is a good opportunity to do some of the extras for those that want to progress in the story will be happy to find that there are passageways that will take them to any area in the game as long as they have been upgraded to do so. For this you will need money to buy them but you can also buy stores and landmarks all over Rome, while the last game did this it was way too easy for the small area of things to buy but now it feels far more worked out.        The obvious biggest change to this game is the multiplayer, which takes on a different idea compared to pretty much all other multiplayer games. Other games want to you running to kill your enemies and finish your objections as fast as possible; this game wants you to go as slow as possible. You are given the task of killing another person in the stealthiest of way not only because you get more points for it but because there are others out to kill you as well. For those that like to run around to find your target might not like this game for its all about blending in and moving as slow as possible to look like an NPC. Things like running, climbing or anything that you would do in the games single player is a definite give away to everyone else. Despite that, the multiplayer is actually pretty fun, planning routes and acting in ways you and the idea of humans doing their best to not be humans gives it a bit of depth that is quite a bit of fun. That’s not to say its without its problems, somewhat small maps making it easy to be killed because they saw you get someone else, and occasional spawning right beside your mark is a bit of an annoyance, other than that it’s a good addition to what they already give you.       With it originally looking like a multiplayer addition with a quickly thrown in story, it’s obvious we got so much more than that. A great story that helps the story and everyone in it, and a fun multiplayer that isn’t afraid to do its own thing, for those that haven’t tried these game yet now would be the best time.       I give an 8/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ Lets get one thing out of the way if you do not like the Assassin’s Creed series you will not like Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and no matter what I say in this review it will not make a difference so you can move along to the next article. OK, now that is taken care of let me start the review. I have always liked the Assassin's Creed series but it has not grabbed me in the way it has other people. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood almost turned me into a believer. The mission design is the best in the series, the story ramps up to even crazier heights, the new assassin management system is great, and the brand new multiplayer modes are so much fun; but game-breaking glitches cripple what should have been a game of the year contender.   The story of Brotherhood picks up literally seconds after the end of the Assassin’s Creed 2 as Enzio has just accomplished his mission of securing The Apple and heads back to the villa to live the rest of his life in peace. Since the game would get pretty boring if it was all Enzio sun-tanning with beautiful women, things quickly go wrong when the villa is destroyed by the evil Borgia family and The Apple you worked so hard for in the last game gets taken away. Enzio now must head to Rome to take down the Borgia family and retrieve The Apple. Meanwhile in the real world, Nathan Draaa- I mean Desmond Miles (as played by Nolan North) must replay through all of Enzio’s memories to find out where Enzio hid The Apple so the Assassins can retrieve it in order to save the world. The story is very well told and is definitely one of the best aspects of the game. All the real world outside of the Animus stuff plays a bigger role in Brotherhood than in previous installments, so depending on how much you like all the 2012 end of the world you will either be ecstatic or disappointed.   The gameplay is relatively similar to Assassin’s Creed 2 but streamlined to be better and faster. The combat has been sped up with the addition execution streaks where after you kill one guy you can jump over to another guy and waste him instantly. This makes the combat feels more like Arkham Asylum with you trying to keep a huge combo while countering everyone that comes near you. The business owning system has also been expanded. Now all the shops are now located in Rome instead of another area and can only be bought after you take out the Borgia’s Towers so they no longer have influence the area. The Borgia’s Tower make the game a little more dynamic since it can make story missions harder if you choose not to take them out and they are the only way to let you buy shops, plus they are fun little diversions. The best new system is the assassin’s guild management. About 6 hours in you get the ability to recruit citizens to your cause allowing you to call them from literally out of nowhere to start fights and assassinate targets. You can also send the recruits all around the world to do missions and level them up to be better assassins. This is a lot of fun to play around with even if the game is easy enough to get through without touching it but nothing is more satisfying than whistling and having a assassin come flying out of the air and onto your target and then running the hell out of their. Unfortunately I experienced a game breaking glitch about 6 hours in that left me unable to re-enter The Animus so I was stuck in Nolan North world forcing me to restart my game. At least 3 or 4 of these type glitches that have been reported and I can not wholeheartedly recommend a game where these type of glitches exist.The brand new multiplayer that has been introduced in Brotherhood is completely unique and loads of fun. There are only 3 modes and 1 mode variation so the it is a little limited but their is still plenty of fun to be had. The default mode and easily the best is Wanted, which is a free-for-all style mode that task you with hunting down a target while trying to avoid being hunted yourself. The 8 players character models populate the map as you follow a vague compass that put you in the general vicinity of your target. You then have to look at the surroundings and determine who is AI and who is the person you need to shank. Players are rewarded with much more points for stealthy and creative kills which is probably the multiplayers greatest strength since it keeps it from being everyone running around like an idiot and encourages you to change up how you mess guys up. This cat and mouse style of gameplay leads to lots of amazing moments where you will nearly be killed by your hunter only to have him taken out by someone standing in the crowd. The 2 team based modes Manhunt, where one team of 4 are hunters and the other team is prey, and Alliance, 6 player mode that splits player up into 3 teams of 2 and has teams competing in a sorta triangle of hunting one team while being hunted by another team, are not nearly as fun as Wanted, because they do not really highlight the “team” and just feel like a more limiting version of Wanted. Brotherhood takes a page out of the Call of Duty playbook with perks, killstreaks, and challenges that allow player to use Disguises and Hidden Guns that significantly change strategies and constantly have you thinking on your toes and add a “carrot on a stick” that multiplayer games require these days. As of the writing of this review matchmaking is kinda broken sometimes taking up to 5 minutes to get into a game, but hopefully these issues will be addressed soon.   Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood does a lot of things right with a robust single player and an excellent multiplayer mode that is different from anything on the market. Unfortunately the egregious glitches made a terrible impression on me and I can not give 5 stars to a game that contains those sorts of glitches.4 out of 5+Expands all the great things from the previous game in the series+Unique and ridiculously fun Multiplayer-Several Game-Breaking Glitches that require to restart your game if encountered    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ A quality of many great video games is there ability to make the player feel like a total bad-ass. Assassin’s creed II is one of these rare games that had the ability to make you feel like a bad-ass and therefore when the time to pick up the sequel came around just a year after its predecessor it was inevitable that I would pick up a copy.  The beginning of the games starts with Ezio right were he was at the end of the last game, deep inside the Vatican. A quick recap of the controls with your uncle Mario as you fight your way out get you back into the swing of things, before you head back to your villa. Here Ezio enjoys some flower arranging, some cannon practice and then the company of a lady friend. However just before Ezio gets to enjoy the fool extent of life as a retired assassin the villa you penny pinched for last game gets blown to itty bitty pieces and he loses all of his armor. This sets up a nice metroid style, you’ve lost all your stuff you ponce go and find it. Ezio rather miffed and several degrees more vulnerable by this point decides to go to Rome to fight back against the Borgia, the family that now run Rome and and love disturbing assassins during there quality time with their lady friends.  Once in Rome the game opens up into the usual stabbing all the dudes between you and and the main target, the head of the Borgia family, Cesare. To help Ezio avenge the destruction of his villa, he will now have the help of the entire Assassins guild, however you first have to build it up from scratch. This new mechanic works by finding civilians in the world that are being harassed by guards ,helping them, and then having them join you. Then with the help of messenger pigeons you send them on missions to get them trained up. The best bit of having the assassins guild is being able to call them at any time to help you out in battle. This is particularly effective when wanting to stay unnoticed by guards, you call your young padawans by whistling and having them fly out of the nearest window and kill all of the soldiers in the area. This is something that really adds to the feeling of being a bad-ass in the game. The ability to get rid of several guards at a whim is incredibly satisfying. The down side is that I became a little too good with them and found myself not using them so that I could get my hands dirty.  To replace the the hole in his heart after the loss of his villa Ezio decides to set himself a new renovation project, the whole of Rome!!! While traversing the the world you will be able to purchase shops that will boost your income that will allow you to buy new armor and weapons. However to buy these shops you have to burn a nearby Borgia tower that has locked the shops out. This works by killing the Borgia captain and then setting the top of the tower on fire. obviously only Borgia captains know how to put out fires. Also thoughout the world there are fast travel points, tunnel entrances, that can be renovated. These are necessary because unlike the first game you spend almost all of your time in Rome, and its big, really big. This I feel gives Brotherhood less character than 2. Rome feels too large and faceless apart from a few well know land marks, where as AC2 had several locations that felt varied and new.  Within Rome there are all of the side trappings of the second entry into the assassins creed franchise are here with a few new ones as an additional distraction from your main objective. Subjects 16’s devilish puzzles are still as frustrating even though there aren't as many this time round, and the Assassin's tombs return just under the name of the Followers of Romulus's treasure. The new side missions consist of courtesan missions and other faction missions that will have you performing a variety of tasks.  The biggest addition to Brotherhood is that of a multi-player component. The main mode is Wanted. The player is contacted to kill another player in whatever way you see fit, you can run on roof tops, you can sneak up from behind, or you can hide in hay bales and wait for him. The other side to this is that there might be some one hunting you, so therefore if your running on rooftops like a nun that's just had her head dress set on fire then your going to get noticed, so it becomes a game of trying to find your guy whilst not being noticed, and the better you do, the more players will be contracted to kill you. All of this adds up to a whole new kind of multi-player that is very intriguing. I am not sure if I will be playing it for as long as Halo Reach but it has peaked my interest and I am having a lot of fun with it, and isn’t that what matters.  Assassins Creed Brotherhood is an excellently put together game that takes its predecessor success and adds to it very successfully. The new assassins guild mechanic makes the player fell much more powerful, and there sheer amount of stuff to be doing in brotherhood means that you can spend hours on it and never complete a story mission. The simplicity of the cat and mouse multiplier is innovative enough that any one that has simply dismissed it hasn't given it a fair chance. Although initially thought of as a side project for the franchise, Brotherhood is a full fleshed out Assassins Creed game that is a requirement for any member of the creed.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Just to start, this is my first review... So moving past that, lets get on with it shall we?  I have been a huge fan of the Assassin's creed series since AC1 was released. Even though many people were bothered to see this franchise was actually a sci-fi game, staring Desmond, I've always been intrigued by the over-arching plot line. Assassin's Creed 2 made huge, huge, huge improvements to the series, and Brotherhood only further's the improving series. There are so many little additions to the game the really make this one feel unique, even in the familiar setting.  Right off the back, Desmond has a much larger role in this game. You can actually wander around as Desmond, as utilize many of the abilities he has gained from the bleeding affect. The supporting characters: Lucy, Shaun, and Rebbecca, have significantly improved in their dialouge and ability to emote. Shaun in particular is a very enjoyable character to talk to. Of course this is all optional, as you never even have to leave the animus once you regain control of Ezio. Speaking of optional, the side quests in the game have opened up so much. From destroying all the borgia towers, to guild quests, to the temples of romulus, to finding and solving the truth puzzles.  There is new implementation in the menu screen that helps the game greatly. Being able to redo specific missions and find the specific buildings is a great help. Even the map now displays the feathers and flags, which is a huge relief to all you completionists out there.   The most interesting new mechanic in the over-world however, is the meta-game for Roma. Buying every single building and shop. Doing so nets you  cool reward, but the process of which is so addicting. I in fact stopped playing the main story line for hours on end trying to nickel and dime my way to buy every shop and do every main side quest. This is kinda reminiscent of fable. except fable 3 left a sour taste in my mouth, while this left me with smiles.  Another inclusion to this series is items. These trade items can be sold, but their purpose is to complete these shop quests. collecting  the certain items gives you access to new weapons, armors, and abilities that aren't accessible otherwise. These items can be acquired from looting, treasure, or from sending your assassin's out to collect them.   These assassins are the main tag line for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. You can train  assassin's by sending them on mission to become full fledged assassins. They amount you can have is equal to the amount of borgia towers you have destroyed. They can also assist you in combat as you see needed. However they can be killed during a mission or in combat, so be careful or else you will need to replace them. Another new mechanic of this game is the memory synchronizations. Every time you take on a quest, there are certain conditions that must be met in order to receive 100%. Otherwise, you'll receive only a 50% completion.  Honestly, some of the conditions where annoying. Aside from the few that made the game play with stealth, I would have stopped caring after I got the achievement for a level with 100% sync, if it wasn't for the Christina memories. These memory sequences may not have been the most amazing side story ever, but for fans of the series and Ezio, it is definitely worth playing to see a more emotional side of Ezio.  The new combat mechanics are pretty interesting. My favorite addition is the long awaited crossbow. I used this weapon in almost every mission. Stealthily one-shoting a person from a far distance makes Ezio feel so much more bad ass then ever before. Another new mechanic, is shooting poison. If it wasn't for this addition I would never have used poison, but it does now have its uses. It's still takes too long to kill an enemy with, and I'm sure that would have been remedied with unlocking fast poison, but I couldn't be bothered to do so.   Generally the sword and dagger combat are still the same, leaving me to fight with my hidden blades. The one improvement to the combat system is quick killing. during combat if you kill an enemy,  you can highlight the next enemy and tap x to attack the next one. This provides a way to instant kill each enemy in a row. This does not feel cheap to me at all, because it helps move the combat along, and add to the generally vibe of the game that Ezio is  bad ass. Adding to that is the addition of the assassin recruits.  You can call in an assassin to help fight with you, but if you let your bar charge up, you can summon a rain of arrows to kill multiple enemies. I found my self defending my assassin's a lot after one was killed in battle.                   Ezio has never looked cooler There are some problems with this game however. It is very buggy. My biggest problem with the game is the parachutes. When they work, it is an awesome addition to the game. Being able to jump off any building and fly down safely, is great. It can even be used to air assassinate enemies. However, it almost never works. Even though I had the max amount of parachutes, the game wouldn't register that I had any, causing many frustrating deaths. Another problem I have is when the arrow is telling me to go underground. Sometimes it seems to have trouble with the height you are at. There are still the occasionally questionable behavior to enemies and npcs when they are climbing walls to go back to their ""posts"".  However, if you can look past these faults, it's still a great game.  The story is very interesting and actually fills in several plot holes within the story. The most significant in my opinion are the parts with Desmond and the truth memory. They solve so many questions about the over-arching storyline, and I have formed several theories about where the series is going. I won't discuss this here though, because spoiling that would be very frowned upon.   ...Now for the multi-player.... It's good. You've probably seen some quick looks already, but it's really  good. I see it as almost the anti call of duty. Its a slow and methodically paced game rather then a twitch based shooter. The level progression is cool, and keeps you playing.  There are a few different game modes, but the one most people will play, myself included, is wanted. In this game type you are after an assigned target while you yourself are being hunted. You have no knowledge about the other players, and can't tell if a character is a npc or the target. Its quite compelling because, if you lack patience and run around, you will be found very often. I find assuming that everyone is after you helps keep you on a proper edge. My only problem with the multi-player is that more often then not, the servers don't work. There seem to be not many people are playing this game, and it's a shame to because its quite a unique little gem.   Overall, I think it's an amazing game. the story, the characters, the setting, all of it comes together wonderfully. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun open world game, or anyone looking to get entangled with a very interesting over-arching story. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I'm of the belief that realistic expectations for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood would be low expectations.  Here we have the third game in a still inconsistent franchise released only a year after the monumentally improved Assassin's Creed 2 with the crux of its marketing campaign being placed on a multiplayer component.  It's true, AC2 was a gigantic step forward from the ambitious, but wholly disappointing Assassin's Creed, but the developers at Ubisoft risked souring that good will by dishing out a half-baked sequel to capitalize on its popularity.  That's why it's not only surprising, but wonderfully miraculous that not only does Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood live up to its prequel's quality, but surpasses it in so many key areas that it is no stretch to call it the best in the series thus far.   STORY For those unacquainted, the story of Brotherhood is a tad hard to summarize.  Basically, you play as Desmond Miles, a former bartender in the year 2012 who comes from a long ancestry of Assassins, a secret organization devoted to safeguarding society through the act of savage neck stabbings.  Using a special device called the Animus, Desmond must re-live the memories of his ancestors to gain their knowledge and abilities in order to combat their rivals, the Templars, in the modern day.  Obviously, the story also revolves around the ancestor whose memories he is currently re-living.  In this case, it is Ezio Auditore da Firenze of Renaissance Italy, an Assassin whose ascension was chronicled in the previous game.  Ezio finds himself in some hot water when, following an attack on his villa, he must go to Rome to combat the full might of the Borgia papacy and restore the once great city to its former glory.  The story here is certainly different than the previous game as Ezio is already established and is now focused on a single goal rather than the long multi-year journey of AC2, but it manages to stay fresh and interesting with its large cast of distinct characters and surprisingly savage and cutthroat tone.  On the Desmond side, there isn't much development until the very end.  When that end hits, however, it'll likely leave you both scratching your head and with your mouth a-gape in shock.   CONTENT Brotherhood is a hefty game.  The main-line story is relatively long at about 10 or so hours, but you can easily double or triple that with the single-player content alone.  The game does a fantastic job of continually throwing more and more activities at you to the point where, just as you believe you're about to get to finish half of what's on your plate, suddenly it's stuffed to the gills with new stuff to check out.  That's not to say some of it is repetitive, but the game does give you incentive for exploring the city and doing as many things as you can either with new toys or helpful gameplay buffs or just more story exposition.  Throw in the city-building aspect of buying properties and the gathering and training of Assassin recruits, and it's easy to become immersed in the activity-filled Roman streets for hours on end.  This also doesn't account for the game's multiplayer, which in and of itself can be played for an immeasurable amount of times.  Realistically, only three game-types and a handful of maps are included in the package as it stands, but the addictive and tense gameplay and constant player progression will ensure you spend at least a little bit of your stay in Italy with some other human players.   GAMEPLAY By now, the gameplay of Assassin's Creed should be fairly familiar.  The game retains its social stealth and acrobatic antics with a few tweaks.  You'll still use a combination of Ezio's dexterity and the populated streets of Rome to locate, tail, and/or kill your targets, but Brotherhood seems to have done its darnedest to eliminate feelings of frustration or helplessness that were found in the previous games, heaping on tools and toys that just beg to be exploited.  Among them are a slew of new ranged tools including a ridiculously deadly and silent crossbow, as well as a better use of the large weapons found in AC2.  All these are aided by the fact that Ezio now has the ability to chain kills together while in combat, allowing you to clear entire swaths of guards with enough timing and skill.  It's not too easy, but it's simple enough a mechanic that helps speed up fights without feeling cheap.  You'll also step into a handful of vehicles for some pretty unique and wholly entertaining  missions for Leonardo Da Vinci.  Poor Leo has been forced to create war machines for the Borgias, but as his best bro, you've agreed to destroy them and their blueprints to avoid their use in harming the innocent.  As such, you'll go through standard stealth missions that will each end with Ezio commandeering and subsequently destroying said inventions.  Although I was in no hurry to jump back on Leo's flying machine (even with its new bombing capability) I must say I got a kick out of a rocket-firing gondola and was delighted when I got the chance to step out from the shadows and into Leo's rickety wooden tank for one ridiculously fun segment. Perhaps the biggest inclusion to Brotherhood's gameplay is the inclusion of the Assassin's Guild, a feature that isn't even introduced until about halfway through the game's story.  Now, Ezio has the option of recruiting rebellious citizens of Rome and train them up to assist him in combat.  This involves a type of strategy mini-game which has you sending your dudes and dudettes out on missions across Europe to build up their skill and strength.  With each level, your recruits get more and better equipment until they finally reach the rank of full Assassin.  Their real value, however, comes in their ability to be called in to assist Ezio at any time (provided they've been given enough time to cool down since last called and/or they aren't all off doing their own thing).  With a simple button press, you can direct your recruits to a target to take them out silently, leaving you to do go on your merry way unmolested.  They can also be called into fights to give you a little more muscle and, if enough are available, they can perform a guard-clearing arrow storm that is pretty devastating when used correctly.  The one caveat is that your recruits can die if overwhelmed in combat or if given a difficult mission, but if you're like me and you don't make any overtly stupid decisions, you'll have a large brace of full Assassins by game's end.  It would also serve to talk about the multiplayer gameplay.  Essentially, the multiplayer on offer is a sadistic version of hide and go seek.  Using mechanics from the single-player, your job is to find and assassinate a given target while also evading your own pursuer.  As such, games quickly escalate into a tense combination of trying to keep a low profile while still staying mobile enough to find your target and score a kill.  Intelligently, the game awards QUALITY kills over QUANTITY of kills so while you could be super conspicuous and charge towards your target with abandon and kill them, you'll get far less kills than if you were to, say, hide with a group doppelgangers while your target passes you, then slowly tail them before calmly and quickly executing them and disappearing once again into the constantly moving crowds.  Eventually, you'll earn more tools to help with your given play-style, but they don't change the game fundamentally.  And fundamentally, the Brotherhood multiplayer is just plain fun.   PRESENTATION Lastly, it's appropriate to talk about the presentation side of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.  This is one good-looking game, although some effects seem to be more implied than actually fully executed (if that makes any sense).  What I mean is that while textures aren't necessarily the sharpest, nor player models the sharpest, the way the game presents them is such that it never exposes any ugliness.  Rome's size is remarkable and its look is equally impressive.  Characters animate remarkably well, and it's Ezio's downright nasty fighting animations that steal the show.  On the sound end, it only gets better.  The period-appropriate music returns here with more haunting and ominous tunes that eventually explode into jangling chase music.  The voice-acting is great from top to bottom with Roger Craig Smith putting in another exceptional performance as Ezio, giving the role both a learned gravitas while keeping the character's cheeky and suave nature intact.  FINAL VERDICT  What more can be said about Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood?  I'd wager nothing, by the size of this review, but I shall close with this sentiment.  If this is to be the height of the AC franchise, then I consider it a success.  This is a game that is not only full to the brim with content, but makes itself thoroughly more enjoyable to play and advances its own story in the process.  Was it necessary to revisit Ezio and Renaissance Italy?  Probably not, but if this were indeed an attempt to cash-in on the success of Assassin's Creed 2, it was a heartfelt and incredibly well-executed one.  It might be lacking for some originality, sure, but after over 24 hours poured into the single player alone, I could care less about originality.  Throw in a superfluous yet remarkably well-executed multiplayer component, and you get a game that, while first looked like nothing more than a side-story, ends up towering above its predecessors.  The wisdom of our creed is revealed to us in these words; nothing is true... except that Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood deserves 5 stars out of 5.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[The Assassin's Creed franchise has enjoyed a speedy accent into AAA franchise status with Assassin's Creed 2. Now comes Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, a sort of ""2.5"" released only 1 year later. Touting the addition of multiplayer and the ability to control a guild of assassins, AC Brotherhood was largely viewed by critics and myself as a cash grab with little in the way of true progression. Boy, was I wrong. Brotherhood picks up moments after the final scenes of AC2 and jumps right into the story. If someone is getting into the franchise for the first time, I'd recommend playing the prior game first... It does move pretty quickly over past events. Desmond Miles and his gang of present day assassins are on the run from templars and get right back into the animus after some fun twists. The game picks up in Rome with Ezio Auditore, the flamboyant son of a banker-turned-assassin. As the Borgia family takes over Rome and destroys Ezio's home, he must fight to unite the people and take back control of the city.      Heights and  being murdered... I'm scared of both The first noticeable feature is the city of Rome. The setting has been painstakingly recreated in amazing detail, which really adds to the authenticity and allure of the game. Collectables and interesting characters can be discovered throughout the city, which is absolutely massive. The tower climbing gameplay is back - but carries more gravity as they can be scaled in order to free up areas of the city from the Borgia rule. Shops, banks, tailors, etc can all be restored in an economy that is surprisingly balanced. The game spends most of its time in Rome, but also ventures into other areas for certain scenes. It really doesn't matter, as Rome is more than large enough to house the entire game.  Another addition is a Training simulator which challenges players in different skill areas for medals and trophies. While it's a very basic setting, it does provide another form of gameplay not found in previous releases of the franchise.  Much has been made in the past about the combat in Assassin's Creed. I've always thought it was realistic - but more importantly: FUN. The same combat engine is back, which some nice improvements. 10+ enemies will attack at once making bigger fights more commonplace. Kill streaks can be chained together, which turns Ezio into a mass murdering machine. The weapons are varied and fantastically brutal. The crossbow, parachute and other additions are a great compliment to an already awesome arsenal. Enough good things cannot be said of the assassination animations... Even after playing for 30+ hours, new combat animations will awe.  The addition of a ""brotherhood"" of assassins is a cool addition, although not very deep. Once recruited, assassins can be called on to help take out guards or targets. Their training is fairly simplistic for the most part, but it does add a cool layer to the gameplay while in combat.    While the storyline doesn't push the franchise too far ahead, there are some nice twists throughout the game. Since the game is a sort of ""bridge"" till Assassin's Creed 3, expectations weren't great that the story would carry too much weight. Players spend much more time in the present day than in the first two Assassin's Creeds, but many of the biggest questions lie unanswered. That said, most of the characters in AC: Brotherhood are great. Cesare, the infamous Borgia military ruler, is fantastic on screen. The voice acting is splendid throughout, but where the sound design really shines is in the soundtrack. AC Brotherhood has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a videogame, period. The chase scenes are accompanied by the type of music usually reserved for a hollywood blockbuster.   Everyone dies! Yippee!     As mentioned before, multiplayer is one of the big additions people looked forward to in Brotherhood. While the gameplay does not have the replay value of a COD multiplayer, Assasssin's Creed does a great job of mixing the stealth gameplay found in single player into a cool multi experience. Locating targets and assassinating them while being hunted provides a tense, unique game not found in many online games. Because guns are not part of the gameplay, getting close enough to a target without tipping them off is challenging. I've just dug into the multiplayer and will get some enjoyment out of it - but rest assured, the single player experience is where AC Brotherhood shines. All in all, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood shines for many reason. The easiest to see is for what it is not: A quick, cheap sequel reusing the former game's assets. Brotherhood builds upon and outshines its predecessors in nearly every facet. If you're a fan of the series, this is a must-own.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ Multiplayer is brought to a game that seems really not well-suited to it. How well does it fare?First  off, this game is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed II. Literally, a  total direct sequel. If you didn't play AC II, you likely will not  really get this story at all. The Borgia family (who, historically,  basically owned the papacy for a long time) has basically come back and  almost wiped out the Auditore family stronghold. They seized the Apple  of Eden and it's up to Ezio to retrieve it. They bring back Leonardo da  Vinci and then add in Machiavelli into the maelstrom of historical  people involved in this series. The game opens up in a very  linear fashion as you are trying to slowly build up your Assassin's  Guild and to remove the domination of the Borgia family over Rome. This  requires you to first find and assassinate a captain, which is actually a  quick and somewhat enjoyable little mechanic. This allows you to  re-open new shops which provides you revenue to buy more shops, fix up  aqueducts, and buy Roman landmarks. As you slowly work your way  through the Borgia clan and their warriors, you start being able to  recruit new assassins to your cause, which makes the entire process of  fighting battles significantly easier since you can call them and they  will appear out of nowhere and kill your targets. They can be killed if  underpowered, but once they are at a high level, they are nearly  unkillable. It makes the fights significantly easier as you will be  overwhelmed if you are not careful.The missions do have a decent  variety. You will tail some people. You will have some where you need  to kill specific people. In others, you need to kill a lot of targets.  You also need to help Leonardo destroy his war machines that fell into  the wrong hands. You also have to attempt to find the treasures in  assorted underground tombs, which basically seem like Tomb Raider  levels. All in all, this is a really enjoyable affair...except  the parts they involve Desmond in the future seem really out of place  and tedious (the final level is boring as all heck). I don't think the  developers have really found a reason for the usage of Desmond but are  unwilling or unable to keep trying to utilize him. Single player  is a solid game, but it is basically AC II all over again. I loved AC  II but I didn't get a whole wealth of evolution in the gameplay. It's  good...but it needs to adapt.Now, multiplayer is the elephant in  the room. The series seemed like the most single-player focused game  this side of Bioshock (it should be noted that Bioshock 2 had a great MP  system, so it's always doable). In this case, the game type I enjoyed  was where you were seeking to assassinate a specific target who was  trying to hide from you while killing their own target. It generated a  rather enjoyable MP game. I didn't play a ton of it, but it was fun for  what I tried.AC Brotherhood is a good game, but it didn't  provide the wow factor of the first two games. The series is a great  series and I do hope they fix some of the niggling problems, but you  won't go wrong with Brotherhood. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[So lets start this review for Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood by talking  about the end of Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood. And I won’t spoil the  ending, except to say the ending sucks. Then again, the ending for every  Assassin’s Creed game sucks. All of the games end with a horrible  cliffhanger, asking players to pipe over $60 to find out what happens in  the next game (and presumably to be left with another horrible  cliffhanger, forever caught in a cycle of cliffhangers.) I begrudgingly  accept that every video game of this generation must be designed with a  sequel in mind, but there are other ways to pique interest without  depriving players of a complete story arc. Look to the Mass Effect games  for lessons on how to create an ending that is both satisfactory and  leaves intrigue for future iterations. Moving on to the rest of  the game. I’ll go on a limb and say that everything you liked and  disliked about Assassin’s Creed 2 is in full effect for Assassin’s  Creed: Brotherhood. For me, things I hate include “the present day,  Desmond, the conspiracy theories, the 2012 bullshit” and things I like  include “pretty much everything to do with Ezio Auditore de Firenze.” So  I walked out of Brotherhood still hating the present day conspiracy  storyline, and still thinking that Desmond is the boring lackey of  Nathan Drake, surrounded by a crew of outcasts that still haven’t gotten  over Firefly’s cancellation. And likewise, I still came out of  Brotherhood thinking that Ezio is the most interesting being in that  entire universe. He nails a checklist of likable traits in a lead hero;  charming, moralistic, experienced, confident, badass with a soft side.  Many of his supporting characters return from Assassin’s Creed 2,  bringing with them their passionate Italian bravado and affection for  profanity.   Horse jacking became very hip in sandbox games for 2010.     The Ezio storyline takes place after Assassin’s Creed  2, with the hometown of the Assassin’s guild being ravaged by an army  of goombas from Rome. His response is to make a trek to Roma and start  over, create a new revolution and overthrow the arsehole Borgia family  in charge. It’s a very straightforward plot, and in this case, that’s  fine. The heroes are valiant rebels, the villains are cackling  oppressive jerks, and you are out to give them their comeuppance. Like  pro wrestling, but with a bit more spandex. What I also like is the  game’s sense of progression in your rebellion. Most games about  rebellions always feel cheap to me, as the work that I’m doing amounts  to nothing. This is usually because at some point, the supervillain  comes in and negates all the work I just did. (think the early portions  of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.) There is no big moment in  this game where the villain, the bitter noble Cesare, mucks your  rebellion over with some strange plot twist. The game gives you a  constant sense of progression; you are gradually chipping away at  Cesare’s grip on Rome while amassing great amounts of power yourself. A  lot of that sense of increased influence over Rome comes from the many,  many, many, many sandbox-ish side quests you can indulge in over your  play experience. First, you can enter “Borgia territory”, and burn down  their Borgia towers to magically remove the Borgia “influence” in that  area. How destroying a single tower removes Borgia influence is beyond  me; am I destroying the Borgia family poker rooms? Do the Borgia guards  leave the area due to their lost bro-out area? After that, you can  invest money into renovating and restoring any of the shops, banks and  blacksmiths in the area and accumulating rent over a period of time.  It’s similar to the property system from the Fable games, but with the  reassurance that you are making a positive contribution to your Italian  heritage. You can pay large sums of money to purchase monuments like the  Coliseum or the Pantheon, but neither provide any kind of benefit  besides the same minor rent increase you get for renovating a clothing  shop. Many, many other sidequests manifest themselves as you  progress. You can take assassination missions, of course. You can  improve relations with the guilds of thieves, mercenaries or female  entertainers with side missions. You can venture into a series of side  missions built around taking down a feral cult or destroying such  legendary Roman weapons as the ancient Roman wooden tank. (Not one of  Leonardo’s better inventions.) You will spend an inordinate amount of  time not progressing the main storyline in favour of doing your part to  rescue Italia, one pizza pie at a time. There comes a point, very early  in the game, where you can look at the user map and panic at the sheer  quantity of things in the world to address. And if you’re like me,  you’ll begin to pick and choose the ones of interest to you and neglect  the others (yes to the cult missions and assassination contracts, no to  the courtesan or shopkeep missions.)   The ""killed after making a kill"" scenario happens quite a bit in multiplayer.     Though you’ll have to be  patient, for the game is very slow to reveal itself. A friend of mine,  someone who is very adept at Prince of Persia, was considerably  frustrated at long it took for Assassin’s Creed 2 to introduce its  concepts. Brotherhood moves at just as slow a pace. I was considerably  annoyed every time I was told I could not access certain Borgia regions  or unlock the next cult missions because I needed to advance the  storyline. Equally as frustrating, albeit perhaps it shouldn’t, was how  long it took to Ezio to regain his second hidden blade. You can’t access  it until after a specific point in the story, and there were many an  instance where I would have loved to stab multiple enemy temples at  once.Mind you, the story missions are mostly solid affairs. They  are about as distinct and interesting as the ones you saw in Assassin’s  Creed 2. Though I was very frustrated at the occasional forced stealth  sequence that would fail you if you were spotted. Part of my frustration  comes from how the game considers it a failure if a guard sees you just  as you begin slicing their eyeballs out. Otherwise, all of the similar  gameplay mechanics from Assassin’s Creed 2 are here; you are still  running around rooftops, running away from guards, hiding in bales of  hay and stabbing people while hiding in bales of hay. The swordplay is  more timing-based; you are still timing button presses to attack enemies  or block attacks, but the game rewards proper timing by letting you  slaughter enemies one after the other. It doesn’t have the same visual  impact of the Batman game, but I understand. I doubt Ezio would stand  much of a chance fighting Batman anyways. There does become  something of a turning point several hours in, when Ezio decides to take  a stab at running his own Assassination guild. First you help a  disgruntled citizen beat up some Borgia goons, and then they swear their  lives in servitude to the almighty Ezio. These goons are so devoted to  your sexy accent that they follow you everywhere, and will pounce at any  guard you point at if you so choose. While on the surface, you would  think that doing so would make the game a little too easy, and well, you  would be a tad right…and then you will be decidedly frustrated during  the stealth-only moments of the game where you can’t use your students.  You can also send your assassins on international contracts to accrue  cash and experience points, and it does become worth your while to level  up your goons with better armour and weapons.   The doctor has the antidote...for your life!        The end result is  a game that is feels conceptually heavy. Property buying,  assassinating, helping the escorts, giving your pupils training  exercises in Lisbon and Paris, upgrading Ezio with weapons and armor,  the ten trillion other sidequests, buying a nice wine-coloured robe to  match your Azure cape…the kind of player that struggles with concepts  like “navigating menus in a video game” or “pressing the run button in  Super Mario Bros” will suffer a minor stroke playing Brotherhood.  Inversely, if you ignore side quests and focus on hunting down the one  villain, then I would guesstimate the game lasting about 4-5 hours. But  immersing yourself in the whole culture of subversively taking over  Roma, I lost myself within the game for about 20 hours. ‘Tis a big game.One  more complaint; there’s a point of no return at the start of sequence  8. After which begins a long string of missions; you can still access  the rest of Rome after completing these missions, but some kind of “hey,  you should buy some nice equipment for this potentially lengthy stretch  of the game” message would have been much appreciated.Oh and by  the by, there’s a multiplayer mode buried within this massive game too.  You may have heard about it since it seemed to take up more of the  pre-release advertising than the whole lengthy 20 hour campaign bit. So  you and a posse of 6-8 colourful characters are in a world populated by  civilians dressed as the other 6-8 colourful characters. In this  elaborate game of hide and seek, you must seek out a single other  assassin, while blending in with the populace and not killing any of the  civilians. Your first few sessions will result in you getting  repeatedly splayed on the floor as you get a feel for what is and isn’t a  good idea. (Hiding in the hay pile isn’t quite the safe haven as it  used to be.) But once you get a grip of the more methodical styling,  then there’s a real sense of gratification that comes with sneaking up  on an unsuspecting dude and breaking their darned neck. While it more or  less borrows its core idea from The Boat, I feel like this is one of  the most creative multiplayer experiences I’ve had in many a moon.So  I sit here, thinking to myself that I will probably never bother to  revisit the campaign again. Not because it’s a particularly bad  campaign, but because I don’t think I can bring myself to redo all of  those assorted sidequests over again in the name of a bad cliffhanger  ending. Mind you, I was borderline addicted to the main quest during my  time revisiting Ezio. That was a good 20 hours of entertainment while it  lasted. And I’m a good deal more interested in the multiplayer than I  would have anticipated. So I would consider that something of an  endorsement. If you liked Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed:  Brotherhood offers a compressed and very dense rendition of that  experience for your consumption. 4 stars ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ Let me start off by saying that Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is a full on sequel to AC2. Ubisoft really shot themselves in the foot by only focusing on the multiplayer aspect of the game, because the single player campaign is just as long and involved as all the other games. There’s never a moment where this game feels like a level pack shoved out a year after AC2. People have that impression because of the multiplayer focused marketing and the fact that you still play Ezio Auditore from AC2. The truth of it is that ACB is the tightest and most fully featured Assassin’s Creed game yet. Just for reference, I put a good 22 hours into the game before I even tried out the multiplayer. *AC2 SPOILER ALERT* AC2 ended on a cliffhanger. Ezio found The Apple and saw a holographic projection of an ancient race who explained to him their history, the prophecy about the end of the world and how Desmond is destined to save them all (Understandably, hearing Desmond’s name confused the heck out of Ezio). Meanwhile, in present day, the Templars have found Desmond, Lucy and the others and they rolled the credits with them on the run in a truck going down a highway. *END SPOILERS*    I hope we won't ever have to use those new cannons we just installed.  ACB picks up right where the previous game left off. Ezio finds himself relocating his family to Rome, and in the future Desmond and the others find themselves in another hideout waiting for Desmond to discover the location of The Apple. Rome is dominated by the Borgia family who controls the city through their army and the Church. In order to fight back, Ezio realizes he must build up his allies so that he’s strong enough to take on the Borgia. This is where the “Brotherhood” part of the game comes in. The majority of the game takes place in Rome, so you won’t be traveling from city to city during this game. But don’t let that fool you into thinking this game isn’t big. Rome is huge and you’ll be pretty far into the game before you find yourself able to clear all the Viewpoints so you can see the whole map.    Hey Ezio! It's a me, Mario! Wanna go do some Castello Crashing? ACB has some great in-jokes.  All the same side missions that appeared in AC2 are back in ACB. There are some tweaks that give more variety and keep things interesting. In previous AC games all you had to do was get to the top of each viewpoint, press a button and you got that map. This time, there are a number of “Borgia Towers” which are restricted areas each of which has a Borgia Captain who must be assassinated before the tower can then be burned, freeing that region from Borgia influence. Each tower has a difficulty rating of 1-5, so some are much more difficult to infiltrate than others. Once a Borgia tower has been taken over, Ezio gains the ability to renovate the local stores, buy landmarks and repair parts of Rome. In AC2 wasn’t long before you had more money than you could ever hope to use, but ACB balances out the rate that you get money better so it’s not until the very end when you find yourself with more money in your pockets than your local bank can hold in its vault. The Rome restoration part of the game has all the fun of buying buildings, but with the convenience of not having to travel to another city to use the game’s economy.    Your mission should you choose to accept it is to stab this fool in the face.  Another way the game mixes up the gameplay is every mission in the game has a “Full Sync” condition that must be fulfilled to get a 100% Sync rating. A few of those conditions include things like taking no damage, not being detected, or killing with a specific weapon etc. If you’re so inclined, this forces you to be more careful and creative in the way you approach your missions. Once a DNA sequence is completed, missions can be replayed via the menu. The missions can be boiled down to: following targets, free-running, killing/avoiding guards and assassinating. But to think of the game as repetitive would be selling it extremely short. For one thing, the missions are changed up by the sheer variety of locations and scenarios you’re put into. Sometimes you’ll chase someone across ceiling rafters, do some fighting, and then end up in a full horseback chase all in one mission. There primary story missions are very well done, sometimes tense, exhilarating and really satisfying when you finally catch up and stab that hidden blade somewhere in that person’s general face area.   Contrary to what the game would have you believe, Ezio does not blend. (Taken from CG trailer)  Ezio’s arsenal and bag of tricks is bigger than ever. All the same weapons return like: swords, short swords, hidden blades, hidden gun, smoke bombs, hammers, maces and good ‘ole fists. There are a few other gadgets that you get courtesy of your old friend Leonardo Da Vinci. There are also some more projectile weapons that make certain situations a lot easier and add variety to the way you can approach a particular mission. Combat has also received a tweak that speeds things up significantly. Whereas before you had to wait and counterattack, you can now select an enemy during mid execution and press a button to instantly kill the next guy. You can chain up some pretty badass combos in this fashion. The guards have some new moves too. They’ll grab you from behind forcing you to break out of the hold by flipping them over. The timing for hidden blade counter attacks is much easier to pull off this time around. I was almost never able to pull it off in previous games.    Lots of checkpoints and helpful proximity indicators in ACB.  The biggest new addition are your assassin recruits. Around five hours into the game, Ezio starts recruiting citizens to join his Assassins. You can send them out on missions throughout Europe in order to level up their abilities, earn money and get special items. The mission system boils down to what’s basically a text based mission system where you don’t see anything go on, but 5-20 minutes later you find out whether they were successful and you get your reward. The gameplay aspect of it is just looking at numbers go up, which the RPG player in me enjoys.   They appear out of the sky like ninja. How could you not enjoy this? (Also from CG trailer)  Aside from that though, you can call them to help you on the street. You target a guard, press LB on your controller and out of nowhere you see an assassin sneak up and stab the guy in the back. The higher their level, the more health and weapons they have. Eventually they’re riding in on horses, shooting guys and using smoke bombs to get away. It’s an easy way out of certain situations, but I’ll be damned if it isn’t a hell of a lot of fun to do. It gives you a great sense of power that with a hand gesture and a whistle, assassins are coming out of the sky. Lots of fun indeed. In the menu you can customize the color of their outfits, but they always wear white when you summon them, which makes me wonder why they let you change their outfits at all. Another game mode is “Virtual Training” which are like the VR missions in the Metal Gear Solid games. They’re in categories of combat, stealth assassination, free running and collecting flags. They look kind of like Mirror’s Edge because of the clean red and white aesthetic, but they provide a nice diversion to practice the gameplay mechanics. I’d love some DLC packs of more Virtual Training scenarios if they made them. The free running ones especially offer some nice tips that can help you out in the story mode. See? Didn’t I tell you there was a full game in this? I haven’t even talked about the multiplayer yet.    ""I'm still alive...STIIIILLLLL ALIIIIIIVE!"" Oh wait, wrong game.  There are a number of modes, but they all play pretty much the same. You’re given a target, and you have to find them and kill them and only them. You have a circular radar on the bottom of the screen with a section that grows wider until it fills up when you’re in the immediate vicinity of your target. The trick is that if you see multiple people with the same character model, you’re not sure which one is an NPC and which is the actual player, so it’s up to you to spot their behavior or wait for them to reveal themselves somehow.   If your radar looks like this and there's only one character model of your target around, then stab that dude in the face!   Meanwhile, there’s always at least one person chasing you at all times. The higher you are on the ranking, the more people that can be on your tail. If you spot your pursuer, you can stun them if you sneak up behind them. Points are also awarded for escaping your pursuer or stunning them. In team mode, points are given in 15-25 point increments whenever you’re blended out in the open. The game rewards stealth play over running straight to your target and killing them. For example, a stealth kill where they didn’t see you coming could net you 400 points, but if you ran and chased after them you might only get 100 points. It’s a very interesting change of pace for multiplayer with a lot of mind games at work. Do you kill the guy in the middle of the group? Or is the person actually on the outside because they assume their pursuer would go for the guy in the middle? Do you pretend to talk to another one of your characters or do you hide in the hay bale next to them? Like all multiplayer games, there’re some extra abilities and perks which enhance your arsenal once you pass a certain level.    As you level up you get cool new abilities and tools like smoke bombs.  Another interesting thing about the game is that the score can dramatically shift back and forth depending on how people play. The more creative you are, the more points and bonuses you receive. Some of them are quite difficult, because aerial kills gain more points, but if you’re climbing on buildings then you make yourself a very obvious target. There’s an achievement for taking the lead within the last ten seconds of the match which I managed to get to my extreme surprise. I’ve only just started, but I’d love to someday assassinate a guy while sitting on a bench or hiding in a bale of hay. The team multiplayer is also interesting because the hunters and hunted take turns. In one round you’re hiding the whole time, and the other you’re trying to find and kill your targets. It’s also fun trying to figure out how to best act like an NPC without giving yourself away.    If you see this dude, stab him in the face because he got this character model by pre-ordering from Gamestop.  Graphically the game still looks like AC2, but that’s still a great looking game. The way the city of Rome is rendered with nice textures and color makes it an incredibly pretty game to look at. They’ll have to up the ante a bit in the next installment either with a new setting or upgraded engine, but good art style can really make up for lack of technical advancement. Kristen Bell’s character Lucy has undergone another remodel, and I’m convinced this is the worst of the three. Her eyes are huge and it just looks awful and weird. All the other character models look good. If I were to harbor a major complaint, it’s that the crowd audio is horribly repetitive. You’ll hear the exact same dialogue bits constantly and it gets old incredibly fast. Other than that, the voice acting is very well done. The only odd thing about the dialogue is I wonder what the decision making process was for what dialogue to leave in Italian and what gets said in English, because it’s downright awkward at times. Also, the breakup of dialogue in the subtitles is arbitrary, occasionally badly timed and in one situation, completely off to the point that the scene ended before the subtitles were close to finishing.     Even in the 15th century, cool guys don't look at explosions.  ACB ends in a cliffhanger bigger than any of the previous games, so I eagerly await the next installment. They’ll probably have to mix up the formula more in the next game to stay fresh, but of the three games, ACB by far has the greatest variety of fun gameplay. It combines so many things that I love to do in games. Stealth kill guys, brutally take out a dozen bad guys in stylishly animated attacks, gain new abilities and buy and build up an empire. Did I mention I like stalking bad guys in games and stealth killing them? If you played AC2 then for goodness sake, play this game! It’s not a spinoff and it’s not a multiplayer only game, it’s the sequel you wanted! If you haven’t played any Assassin’s Creed games I’d suggest starting at the beginning because there is a big story being told here. It’s a bit difficult to recommend the first because they were still figuring things out and it’s really repetitive. If you want to skip the first I can’t blame you, but make sure you catch yourself up on the fiction either via Wikipedia or videos on YouTube. If you like light RPG elements, buying stuff in games and stabbin’ guys in the face then Assassin’s Creed should not be missed. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed was a good game marred by many overt flaws that hindered players enjoyment.  It's sequel Assassin's Creed II took all the criticisms to heart and delivered what in my mind was the single best game to be released in 2009.  Gone were the tedious “investigations” and extremely long travel times from city to city and in its place was an action title that made you feel like more of a bad ass than Kratos in the God of War series and it was all wrapped around an engrossing narrative that in my option stands as one of the best ever in a game. Needless to say, after I finished Assassin's Creed II, I wanted more.  Expecting a two year wait for Assassin's Creed III, you can imagine my surprise when Ubisoft announced Assassin's Creed:  Brotherhood would be releasing this fall and it would be a direct continuation of the Assassin's Creed II storyline.  That excitement was dimmed a slight bit though by the announcement that not only would there be a single player campaign but that the game would also feature a full multiplayer suite.    Assassin's Creed, since it's inception, has always been a single player experience with a strong focus on narrative.  If development time,  which was already shortened, was going to be spent on multiplayer then the single player campaign would surely suffer right?  Wrong.  Not only does Brotherhood have an extremely unique and robust multiplayer mode but it features a full length Assassin's Creed campaign that does nearly everything its predecessor did but better.   Brotherhood picks up immediately after Assassin's Creed II ends, with Ezio making an escape from the Vatican.  If you have yet to play Assassin's Creed II and you were looking to jump into the series with Brotherhood, I strongly advise you to go back and at least play AC II because the story and events in Brotherhood will make very little sense, especially early on, without the knowledge of the ongoing narrative.  Once he has escaped Rome, Ezio heads home to plan the Assassin's next move in their age old war against the Templars but before anything can be arranged the villa of Monteriggioni comes under attack and is over run forcing Ezio to retreat as the villa is destroyed around him.    All of this of course is taking place in the Animus, the virtual memory simulator that allows people to go back in time through inherited memories from their ancestors, and it does not take long before players are back in the real world controlling Desmond Miles, the descendent of some of history's greatest assassin's.  In past games Desmond has not been much more than a story piece that helps to glue the overarching narrative together, however Brotherhood changes that by making him more of a focus.  This is evident almost immediately as players will control Desmond as he back tracks Ezio's escape route from Monteriggioni, using his newly developed assassin skills to traverse the ruins of the old villa. If you have played any of the Uncharted games, the early Desmond portion of the game may leave you feeling a bit of deja vu.  The banter between Desmond and his handler Lucy is very reminiscent of banter between Nathan Drake and Chloe Fisher in the Uncharted games.  I suppose this can be chalked up to voice actor extraordinaire Nolan North voicing both Desmond and Drake and the setting, an ancient ruined building, being very similar in scope.  Regardless of its intentional similarities, the level does a lot to endear Desmond as a character to the player, which comes into play much later in the game. As much fun as Desmond is to play, Brotherhood still belongs to Ezio.  Much like the theme behind Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood is about revenge.  Unlike AC II though, Brotherhood focuses on revenge against just one person, Cesare Borgia, the Templar Grandmaster, in just one place, Rome.  As such Brotherhood does not share the same scope as AC II but do not let the narrower focus fool you though because the campaign will run you just as long as AC II's storyline did, if not longer and focus on just one major mark works to make the narrative even more focused than it already was. While Brotherhood does kick off right where the last game left off, with Ezio being the end all be all of assassins, the game pulls a bit of a Metroid taking away all of Ezio's cool toys that Leonardo da Vinci had made for him though a piece of narrative.  It will not take long though before Ezio is back up to snuff and killing guards with immeasurable style and the combat engine has received a few tweaks that make it much easier to feel like the unstoppable killing machine that Ezio can be.    Countering was the big mechanic in the last game and it still is to an extent in Brotherhood but only in regards to kicking off execution chains.  When faced with a platoon of enemies Ezio can now block and counter an attack setting him off on a string of one hit kills that are majestic to watch.   It may seem like the combat has been watered down to appease to newcomers but this is simply not the case.  To counterbalance Ezio's combat mastery, Brotherhood throws more enemies and stronger ones than players have ever faced in an Assassin's Creed game to date.  The swordplay can get fast and furious and potentially overwhelming for people who have never played an Assassin's Creed title before. As fantastic a swordsman as Ezio is, there are times when situations call for a different approach.  Sometimes silence is just as important as being able to take down 25 soldiers without getting hit and so climbing, jumping, and generally performing acrobatic feats of inhuman abilities are the name of the game and Ezio is as slick and nimble as he ever was..  The platforming in the Assassin's Creed series has always been a point of great debate and while Brotherhood does throw in trickier sections to navigate, there still is that sense of being on auto-pilot at times.  Personally I love it but I can see where someone might want more control. Being an acrobat and a walking killing machine will only get you so far in Brotherhood though.  To get at Cesare Borgia, Ezio must first undermine the Borgia influence in Rome.  To do this Ezio will enlist the help of what most would perceive as the scum and villainy of the city but in this world where assassins are the good guys, I suppose anything goes.  Before he can enlist the help of the thieves, mercenaries, courtesans and even the common people of Rome though he must free them.    Each district of Rome has a series of sub-district that house Borgia towers headed by a captain.  Killing the captain frees the people in that area allowing them to get involved in the resistance movement.  It also opens up what is quite possibly the most addictive aspect of Brotherhood, the rebuilding of Rome.  In Assassin's Creed II, Ezio could rebuild his villa and while it was beneficial to do so, it was also kind of a pain in the neck as one had to leave the story based area and return to the villa to do anything.  Rebuilding Rome is much, much easier. With every Borgia Tower that is taken over, new shops and landmarks (like the Pantheon or the Colosseum)  open up that Ezio can purchase, which in turn generates income that benefits the Assassin's guild and not the Borgia.  The more towers Ezio destroys, the more power the guild has within Rome and while the majority of the towers are side quests, I found myself needing to destroy them all so I could open more shops and get more money.    Taking down the Borgia Towers also has the effect of benefiting Ezio in a couple other ways outside of income.  Freeing the areas gets the common people involved in the cause and getting everyone involved will make things much easier on Ezio's mission, from moving around to having the common folk help out in battle.  Freeing the areas also plays into possibly the biggest addition in the game, the ability to call in assassins to help you eliminate guards or join you in battle. Eliminating Borgia influence gets people to join your cause and these people join the Assassins Guild as lowly trainees.  Each of these recruits has the ability to rise in the ranks of the guild by earning experience when Ezio calls them into battle or by going on assassination missions throughout Europe via a robust contracting system.  The stakes are high though and these assassins can die in battle.  It can be quite gut wrenching realizing you made the wrong decision to call in your hit squad only to realize far too late  they have no hope for survival.  The managing of the assassin's is a game unto itself and will surely see many people putting a ton of time into it. All of this is done in and around the iconic buildings of Rome.  The scenery is breathtaking at times and climbing to the top of the Colosseum is something that just needs to be experienced to understand the size and scope of the city.  Still as amazing as it looks, I couldn't help but feel a bit cramped by the setting.  Past Assassin's Creed titles have had you gallivanting from city to city and Rome, despite being larger than all of Assassin's Creed II's cities put together, Brotherhood's setting felt a bit blasé.  But wouldn't you know it, the developers even thought of a way around that one. Leonardo da Vinci was a major player in Assassin's Creed II but in Brotherhood, he is not much more than a bit character.  However he plays a major role in allowing players to cleanse their palettes of Rome.  Leonardo has been tasked by the Borgia to create a series of weapons and he asks Ezio to destroy the blueprints and devices.  All of these Leonardo missions take place outside of Rome in distinctly different looking settings.  Leonardo's missions are not the only side quests to partake in though.  Like Assassin's Creed II there is a series of shrines to locate and traverse and while I did not find any of them to be quite as inspired as what was in AC II, they were almost always fun and inventive.    All in all the single player campaign is stunning and somewhat shocking considering the amount of time between Assassin's Creed II and this game.  From a narrative perspective, Brotherhood continues the excellent story of Ezio set forth previously and it starts to bring the happenings of Desmond's world into focus.  Brotherhood answers a lot of questions that were left over from AC II but in doing so it also opens up a whole plethora of new ones, especially the shocking ending.  Finishing Brotherhood left me with the same feeling as AC II did and I am now even more impatient for the official third game in the franchise.    For those looking to continue their assassinating ways after the credits roll, Brotherhood features a unique and fully realized multiplayer suite making Brotherhood one of the most polished games to come out this year.  The multiplayer mode even goes so far as to work itself into the fiction and give it a reason for existing.    The core premise of the multiplayer is that you work for the Templars and are using the Animus to train.  Players will select an in game persona, ranging from a common doctor to a stylish Hellequin.  Each player will be given a mark and you will never be stalking the person that has you as a mark.  Players will try to blend in with their surroundings so that they don't give themselves away to either their mark or their stalker and when played correctly the game has is a battle of wills, a stealth game tuned to perfection.  As silly as the concept sounded to me initially I have to admit that when the mode works, it works very well. Sadly though,  roughly half the matches I have been involved in featured players ignoring the premise and running on rooftops attempting to get as many kills as quickly as possible.  Being as the game actually awards players for playing the game properly, with more points for quiet, unseen kills, it makes little sense as to why people are in essence ruining the experience.  And leveling up grants you a variety of useful perks that make the game even that much more fun. There is a strong contingent of fans that want to play the game properly though and once the mass appeal of running on rooftops and killing your buddy wears thin, those players will dwindle and eventually the multiplayer will balance out.  Sadly in an era of what is the next big thing, I more than likely won't be there to partake.      I'm sitting here at the end of this review realizing that I have not spoken at all about the technological aspects of the game and I think their exclusion from this review is more than enough of an indication that Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fantastic game where it counts and spending time talking about textures, animations or the musical score is a waste of space.  Suffice it to say though. all those things are fantastic in Brotherhood just like the rest of the game.    In a time and age where quick cash-in sequels are ever prevalent, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has no business being as good as it is or doing as much as it does.  It is nice to see a developer step up and respect their fans and if you are even a cursory fan of the Assassin's Creed series you owe it to yourself to continue the adventure.  Originally published at Vagary.tv  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I have always been interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise but wasn't sold at all till the second instalment. When I found out the next game in the series would be set in the same location as the second I wasn't entirely happy but what comes from this choice is a refinement on everything that made Assassin's Creed 2 great.  Surprisingly Brotherhood has a fully fledged single player that picks up straight after the ending of Assassin's Creed 2. You start as Desmond Miles in the back of a truck and before long you are back in renaissance Italy as Ezio Auditore de Firenze. Instead of the usual selection of cities Brotherhood all takes place in the city of Rome which is a large and beautiful environment for your adventure. Throughout the game you have the option to purchase shops and landmarks which will in turn increase your income in the same way games such as Fable have done before. Rome is a varied place to explore from narrow streets to open expanses and it is populated by great AI that make the city feel real.  The gameplay does not change much from Assassin's Creed 2 but some tweaks and improvements make a definite improvement. My favourite addition by far is the Brotherhood. You are now able to recruit and train your own Assassin's to send on missions and help you on your own. If you find a citizen fighting the controlling Borgia in the city you can help them and recruit them to your cause. After recruiting Assassins you can send them on missions allowing them to gain experience and upgrade to better armour and weapons. However, the best part of this is that with a simple wave of your arm your brothers drop from the sky slaying your enemies without a sound. This makes you feel so much more powerful than in previous games and is easily the best part of the game. Viewpoints have also changed now with the addition of guards and a general who must first be assassinated before taking over the tower. These feel like mini missions and I would spend a lot of time scouting the area before perfectly executing my plan.  The progression of Brotherhoods story is quite simple but the mission types are varied enough. Smaller missions are simple but others will take planning and time making them a lot more rewarding. When you compare the missions to those offered in the first Assassin's Creed it would be hard to believe they were the same franchise which is definitely a good thing. The conclusion to Brotherhood is bold and memorable leaving my very excited for the rest of the story.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the first AC game to come with a multiplayer component and for the most part it is pretty solid. At the start of a game you select one of 8 avatars and then the world is filled with AI of the same appearance. You then get given a target and your job is to pick them out of the crowd and assassinate them. The twist is at the same time you are someone else's target meaning you have to get the balance right of finding your target while being inconspicuous. I love the multiplayer but it is not quite there yet. When you are being chased you have the opportunity to stun your pursuer but I never really got the hang of the timing. There is some persistence as you earn experience and level up but I never really got pulled in and the perks never seemed particularly useful. It is a really great start to multiplayer but there are definitely some bugs to be ironed out.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood isn't a huge step up from its predecessor but minor tweaks make it a great addition to the series. Multiplayer has some flaws but will keep you entertained enough to make it worth the developers time. If you like Assassin's Creed franchise don't let the lack of a number in the title make you miss this one.   ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is pretty much a direct sequel to AC:II. Things pick up right after the end of the of that game, and without giving anything away, just know that you’ll be controlling the Assassin  Ezio Auditore da Firenze once again and for certain bits Desmond as each get closer to obtaining the information they are seeking.    Hungry for Apples    The mysterious Apple of Eden is an item that everyone seems to be interested in Brotherhood. It’s mysterious power could turn the tide in anyone’s favor so Ezio and his band of Assassin’s seek to keep it from the Templars and many dangerous leaders, most notably Cesare Borgia.  To accomplish this, you can recruit civilians to build up a band of Assassins that will aid in the liberation of Rome. The story is a great one once again, but as with the previous games, the end will leave more questions to be answered.  Can I join? Recruiting Assassin’s is a pretty easy task: all of the potential ones will be under attack when you find them by guards, so you must help them out to recruit a new member. Once you have more assassins, you can send them on missions to increase their skills and rank them up to become an equal to Ezio and the rest of the Assassin guild members.   It’s pretty awesome later in the game when you get bombarded by too many enemies and can call in help from recruits and even the odds a bit on your side. This really fits the Brotherhood meaning from the title, and a nice element for this franchise.    WTF! I thought that was you!   A new addition to Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is the multiplayer, and man is it fun! You can choose from a few nice modes, but my favorite is wanted. In wanted, you must track down and kill a target while avoiding someone hot on your tail. You choose characters that range from Doctors to Harlequinss, but the kicker is that the world is populated with NPCs that are based on the real players in the match. Let’s say you have to kill a doctor and he his nearby since your radar assists you, but you see four doctors in an area. One of them is the real target, so it’s up to you to find that out. Failure to kill the wrong target will result in a loss contract, as well as more time for your hunter to find you.   With a rank of 50 to achieve and unlockable items and abilities at each level, Brotherhood’s multiplayer is no joke. Like with Splinter Cell Pandora, Ubisoft has crafted a new multiplayer experience that can’t be beat.  Conclusion The single player is once again a strong aspect for Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, only this time it’s accompanied by some awesome multiplayer modes. Even though it’s not a numbered sequel, Brotherhood fits in nicely alongside Assassin’s Creed I & II. If you loved those games, you’ll love this one.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Following precisely from where Ezio’s last escapade left off, Assassins’ Creed Brotherhood plunges the player into a series of explosive opening sequences which lays the path for the Assassins’ new struggle against the Borgia armies. Whereas the previous games allowed entrance to multiple cities, Brotherhood reduces its number of sandbox playgrounds to focus exclusively on the city of Rome, and what a beautifully orchestrated environment that is. The area is allotted with familiar details you’ve come accustomed to with the series, with ridges and pigeon holes allowing Ezio to easily scale across buildings, whilst new mechanics enable faster and easier passage through the vast Roman architecture. Horses are now a viable mode of transport within the gates of the city, whilst rope lifts enable an immediate launch to the top of buildings and a new underground tunnel network allows for instant transport from one point to another via the world map. The concept of using towers as sync points to reveal parts of the map remains, but is given context with the use of Borgia Towers, areas that require you to kill the captain of the Borgia influenced area, and reclaim that section of Rome. This not only reveals the surrounding area on the city map but also lets you purchase and use property and services in that area. This expands on the last game’s renovation options in the villa, using a Fable-esque system to buy and open shops, tunnel entrances, and also renovating unused buildings for use of factions to help you, presenting Ezio as a bit of a property developer on the side when he’s not busy stabbing people in the neck. The amount of income you receive is controlled by having to manually retrieve your money from the banks you own, which are limited by the amount of resource they can hold based on how many banks you’ve opened, but the general premise remains – the more property you own, the more income you receive.Although situated primarily in Rome, Brotherhood has a deceptive variety of environments for you to explore, from descending into underground dungeons to revisiting memories of Ezio’s pursuit of a girl in Florence. The game also delves deeper into Italian history with likes of exploring Da Vinchi’s various machine concepts, having fallen into enemy hands requiring you to retrieve the machine, resulting in a rigid mission structure which comprimises of a stealthy infiltration to get the machine followed by an explosive escape sequence where you take control of the captured device and turn it back on its captors. When exploring environments there’s still the issue of the game preventing you from entering areas of the map it doesn’t want you to, which is given context by the Animus not having the memory available to you. However even on missions with a primarily linear level design, I found this was used to keep me straying too far off track, or prevented me from going into an area if there was something else I had to do first.    Combat mechanics have ultimately become more streamlined, predominately with the use of one-hit executions, which allow you rack up chains of kills after a single enemy has been brought down. The arsenal of weapons available to the player has also increased, on the verge on becoming slightly cluttered if it wasn’t for the context given to certain weapon uses, such as whether or not you’re taking a stealth approach on a target. The new concept of hiring assassins to fight alongside you is a profoundly effective way of dispatching your targets, using up a recharging resource bar to trigger your assassin to leap out of the nearest corner ambushing their victim, or calling in a hail of arrows that wipes out everyone on screen. When you are not in combat, the parkour exploration of the city is still as much of a joy as it always was. Game missions often include elegant set pieces for you to maneuver through, though some of the pursuit or escape missions were often a case of establishing simple environment puzzles and repeating them.At a glance, Brotherhood’s visuals may only seem a minimal improvement over the previous game, but that’s not to say the game’s rendered spaces aren’t still utterly gorgeous. There are still some frame rate issues now and again, and texture pop-ins are indeed noticeable, but subtle changes in environmental aspects such as the game’s lighting shows there has somewhat been an overhaul of the engine. Though the camera can be a little inconsistent when controlling jumps through the more enclosed areas, and the often present load screens hang a little longer than you would probably want them to, Brotherhood is technically still a bit of a spectacle to behold. Overall the game does encompass itself as a slightly familiar experience, though it’s evidently a refined and streamlined affair that has enough content to ensure your visit to Rome is indeed a pleasant one.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Ezio´s trek through renaissance italy and his struggle to overthrow the Borgia is a journey that once again casts a shadow over Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Because unlike the entry that preceeded it (Assassin's Creed II) Brotherhood is more of a diversion too keep fans busy prior to a possible fullbodied third game, thankfully, its a really good diversion. Not only does Brotherhood add meaningful improvements and additions to the table but also introduces a multiplayer component too boot, on top of an already long, engaging adventure.  Leonardo´s war machines almost make you feel bad as you lay waste to guards effortless.Like Assassin's Creed II, we once again don the skills and the looks of the full fledged assassin Ezio, and Brotherhood takes him aswell as his modern day counterpart Desmond to some harrowed places. For one thing, the entirety of the ""Ezio experience"" takes place strictly within the looming walls of Rome and the ongoing conflict between the assassins and the mighty templars haven´t died one bit. The same goes for Desmond and his band of fugitives who setup a shop in -- (a place so clever that i wont spoil it for you) as Desmond must still utilize the Animus as a training device aswell as uncovering exactly what the gods message was all about. The story still plays many mindtricks on you as the story within the Animus is a fairly basic one but the one outside of it is not. On the whole the story is good but lacks that immediate charm that permuated the second game. Leonardo Da Vinci has hardly any screen time and the villain Ceasare Borgia is about as boring and one dimensional as villains come and go, despite the stakes being higher. Because now Ezio must gather assassin trainees to complement his own abilites because the Borgia is now a force to be reckoned with, seeing how they have complete control over Rome, its up to Ezio and his band of cunning killers to rip them a new one but aside from a rather intriguing ending, the story still feels abit underhwhelming compared to the second one. When it comes to gameplay, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is what you´d expect. The traversing and combat mechanics remains largely the same as last years game but do benefit from some improvements, both major and subtle. On the combat side you can now chain executions into a gradifying streak and the controls remain intuitive. However, enemies now actively attack you instead of just waiting around to recieve the cold-metal treatment and they are more than capable of interrupting any execution streak. You will still deliver plenty of counter attacks, though and the new animations are brutal and exhilarating. Plattforming still works very well, and you no longer need to nudge your stick in akward ways to do a backwards jump for example and the new plattforming lairs provide great incentive to try out your parkour skills.The biggest addition however comes in the form of a new meta game where you´ll rescue and recruit citizens into your posse of   Ezio is quite the ladiesman.assassins. These can then be called into action at any time with the press of a button to clear out a guarded area or to do your shady buisness for you. However, these seem to come more in handy during some of the stealth based missions where remaining hidden is a necessesity and if you want you can spend time to send them out on missions and upgrade their repetouar of weapons and armor through a very sleak interface. However, its still possible to play through the game and not use your assassins without feeling particularly challenged or feeling like your missing something since thieves, mercenaries and prostitutes can still be used as means of distraction.Also new is the addition of the boriga towers and the renovation of city districts. Each area on the map is often being conquered by a single borgia tower and the officers and guards that patrol around it. If you eliminate the captain prior to burning down the tower in question, you can rejuvenate that district by opening up shops and services that will then earn you income which you can still spend on purchasing weapons, armor pieces and other little tinkers and gadgets and overall the monetary system is still a sharp component that adds to the depth.  Rome´s most famous landmarks make for excellent killing grounds.Like Assassin's Creed II, there is still a great deal of freedom to your quest. You can pursue all of the main missions and plow through the game in roughly ten hours but should you tackle the many side missions, plattform based lairs, take the time off to restore Rome to its former glory or manage your guild of Assassins, you can expect many more hours of playtime and there are still hidden treasures and flags waiting to be gobled up. There are many varied activities to experience here as there are many missions that involves infiltrating landmarks and assassinating key figures but stealth, escort and operating war machines courtesy of Leonardo Da Vinci runs the gambit and it will likely take you another playthrough to find and see everyhting. As if 15-20 hours wasn't enough to warrant the price tag there is also a multiplayer component here, complete with a leveling system that will grant you more customisation options in the long run. No matter the mode, you will almost always be assigned to a target that you must assassinate using means of subtelty as doing so will grant you more points and cause you to climb the leaderboard. The twist is that every match is populated by patroling, artificial characters that you may want to skulk among to lure your pursuer. The location of your target is indicated by a round compass that fills up as you near him/her but it never points out exactly where your target is so you need to look out for movements resembling a real player. Matches mostly bogs down into tense chase sequences, but playing sneaky and doing well can be incredibly rewarding and using your abilites such as disguise and smoke bombs at the right time can make all the difference. I did experience a couple of crippling issues though. For starters, the matchmaking is absolutetly ridicilous, even as i jumped from mode to mode. By average, it took me ten minutes just to find a match and there where numerous ocassions where players would leave right in the middle of a game, thus causing it to end. Also, many of the team based modes are real yawners, such as one where your team will alternate between playing as hunters and escape artists, removing the tension of stalking other players while simultaneously being hunted. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood does look stunning. The city of Rome is enourmous, populated by all sorts of incredible details and the sharp character models, graceful animations and the organic feel and look of the environments are still top notch. Not everything is super polished though as the frame rate was madly inconsistent at certain spots and i did run into serveral glitches, such as one where i fell through the ground and was forced to revert back to an earlier checkpoint. The voice acting is still great, as is the beautiful soundtrack that bolsters the game´s atmosphere by a great dealSo yes, the camera isnt always the perfect, the game abit glitchy and as a whole Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood lacks that awesome leap between the first and the second game, but added variety, a wide plethora of gameplay improvements and an interesting multiplayer component does make this another shining entry in a series that keeps growing at a steady pace.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[        I must be playing a different Assassin’s Creed franchise than everyone else. I mean, this can’t possibly be the game that was a runner-up for game of the year on Giant Bomb and received positive reviews almost universally (even from Destructoid who gained infamy for giving Assassin’s Creed II a 4.5 out of 10). I’m going to be blunt about this: Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood is not a great game. Hell, I can barely consider it a decent game. Some interesting new mechanics, solid characters, and a superb multiplayer mode elevate this game, but severe control issues, mediocre graphics, and a terrible ending to Ezio’s story may leave some with an unpleasant feeling when all is said and done.         The game starts off immediately after Assassin’s Creed II ended, with Desmond and crew still on the run from the group known as Abstergo, a.k.a. the modern day Templars, after their first base of operations was attacked. They group arrive at the Monteriggioni Villa, Ezio’s base of operations from Assassin’s Creed II (Which looks suspiciously similar after all these years, except for the addition of some cars and street signs.) The group set up shop here and plug Desmond back into the Animus in order to discover where the Apple of Eden is hidden. Evidently the Apple will reveal the location of the temples that were introduced in the end of Assassin’s Creed II, which hold the secret of preventing the unknown event that wiped out life on Earth long ago. Why can only the Apple of Eden do this, and not the many other pieces of  spread all over the world? Who knows! But this totally unexplained concept doesn’t get the modern Assassins down, and they proceed to let Desmond step into the shoes of his charming Italian ancestor once again.             After the transition is made to 15/16 century , we see Ezio Auditore de Firenze, the in-Animus protagonist from the previous title escape from  after fighting the pope, and returning to his villa with the Apple of Eden. His villa proceeds to be destroyed by Cesare Borgia, the son of the main villain from Assassin’s Creed II. (Again, why does it look the same in present day? It makes no sense!) Ezio loses the Apple, and has to travel to  in order to get it back from Cesare. Here Ezio meets some old friends (and family) and proceeds to fight the Borgia for control of .          The voice acting in the game remains good, with Roger Craig Smith and Shawn Baichoo turning in the best performances as Ezio and Niccolò Machiavelli, respectively. The voicework for Desmond and co. is a little flatter than the voices for the people in the Animus, but I still like them well enough (I feel like the only gamer that actually does). Some of the conversations you can have outside of the animus with them are particularly good. However, Cesare Borgia’s voice actor is hopelessly cheesy, and easily one of the worst aspects of the games audio. The guards still sound stupid, but there is no line that is as absolutely dreadful as the “Shoot the flying demon” line from Assassin’s Creed II.          The quality of ther aspects of the sound design are fair to great, with the stabbing sound unchanged from previous titles, decent waling/climbing sounds, and an original score that is quite good.          The writing is fairly solid as well, and Ezio and Machiavelli once again fare the best. In particular, the last lines the two exchange are simply superb. The writing for the modern crew is actually a little better this time around. In particular, Shaun Hastings, the cynical British one, is actually sort of funny this time around, instead of just horridly obnoxious. Once again, the villains suffer from the worst writing. Nearly all of Cesare’s lines are variations on “I’m invincible” for the last half of the game, and the guards still spout the generic “hey, what are you doing here” and “IMA KILL YOU” lines that haunted the otherwise solid writing of Assassin’s Creed II. It should be noted that Minerva makes another appearance in this game, and that her lines are more excessively cryptic in this game.          Regardless of the relative quality of the writing, the story is fairly disappointing. Strike that, it’s very disappointing. The first third of the game is based around recruiting factions to help discover Cesare’s location, and then develops into a story of the Assassins attempting to free  itself from its Borgia oppressors, and rejuvenate the city to restore it to its former glory. Unfortunately, the latter plot doesn’t really go anywhere, as the game stops making you think about Rome as a whole about halfway through, and there really isn’t much incentive to do so in the main game, other then making the city look marginally prettier.          The plot stagnates for the majority of the game, as you go around killing Cesare’s lesser men and performing other not-so-important tasks, which really feel as though they have no bearing on the game’s ending. Because Ezio completed his character arc in Assassin’s Creed II, there is an insufficient amount of development to be found in the game. There are a few good moments that revolve around Machiavelli and Ezio’s sister, Claudia. Unfortunately, Leonardo de Vinci is not nearly as important in this game as he was in the previous title. There are a few flashback missions that revolve around Ezio’s relationship with a woman named Cristina that are solid as well, but none of these scenes carry the same resonance as anything from the previous title. But really, the story’s weakness lies, for the most part, in its ending. I won't spoil it, but let it be said that the end of Ezio's story is not good         But the game does not simply fall short in terms of the plot. The game design is simply flawed in more ways than the previous installment was. The combat and the platforming are still very stilted and awkward. There is a delay between controller input and character animation, and that leads to a lot of frustration. Questionable mission structure, pacing, and other mechanics sour the single player experience as well.          As is par for the course in this series, the combat is… not good. The same system is in place, where Ezio can attack, block, kick, grab, and counter. The kick is only good for stronger enemies who can inexplicably block every normal attack and break your blocks, and the grab is useless. The most efficient way to bring down a group of enemies is to hammer the ‘counter’ button while waiting for a foe to attack. Unfortunately, this still does not vanquish foes as quickly as it should, because enemies still take forever to actually execute an attack, leading to rather tedious stalemates. Now, when you are finally able to counter an attack, you now have the ability to string together one hit kills. This is done by pointing in a direction and hitting the attack button while Ezio is performing a kill animation on a target. This system is handy because it lets the fights end sooner, but it feels just as awkward as any of the game’s other combat mechanics. Because it I never specified when during the animation the game has registered the next one hit kill, attempting to string these attacks together results in a lot of button-hammering as you wait for Ezio to finish the previous kill animation. These animations are all lengthy, and they do not flow well together at all. There was no work done here to assure that Ezio’s movement would look fluid and natural as he transitioned between enemies. Instead we see him finish one kill, reach the end of that animation, stop for a split second, then begin the next animation. It looks bad, plain and simple. This system also brings to light issue with the targeting, as Mr. Auditore will often attack an enemy you weren’t aiming at, which is frustrating because that can lead him into a large group that will disrupt your string of one hit kills.            The often celebrated “semi-automatic” platforming of the previous titles returns, and is just as unwieldy here as ever, if not more so. Ezio’s gravitation towards these climbable objects still feels strange, and this attraction makes his movement feel and look very clunky, which is in direct contrast to the idea that Ezio is an agile assassin. The problems of the combat’s targeting system appear to manifest themselves in the platfoming as well, since very often Ezio will completely misinterpret where you wanted to go, often leading to a deadly jump to the ground. The latency between button presses and onscreen action also takes its toll in the climbing. During a few chase sequences, I often found that Ezio would sooner run up a wall and get attacked rather then turn 90 degrees (the way I was pointing with the analog stick) and actually run down a road. That’s a problem with the control scheme as well, since the game follows the mentality of having one or two buttons do everything. It leads to misinterpretations of actions, and makes the player feel less involved. Honestly, Ezio feels like he’s on autopilot most of the time, with the player only controlling his direction, and because he goes a different direction about 25% of the time, this leads to frustration. Climbing up towers is more annoying now too, mainly because of the abundance of false paths on the sides of these tall buildings. While it should make it more of a challenge, it really just makes the climbing more annoying. Also, there is still the issue of platforms that are above Ezio at 45 degree angles. Because the controls only interpret up, down, left, or right, figuring out which of these directions to hit to reach a handhold at a weird angle is also a source of annoyance (it’s usually left or right). Now, the platforming isn’t inherently broken, it’s just extremely flawed. Swinging on hanging pots still looks cool, and there are some satisfying sections here and there, but for the most part it just isn’t that great.         Any inclusion of stealth in the single player is also implemented fairly terribly. The concept of “hiding in plain sight” doesn’t really work, because the game is extremely finicky regarding which groups of people you can blend into. You still have to awkwardly position yourself behind something to avoid the gaze of guards, which just feels weird. Would a corner-cover mechanic (à la Batman: Arkham Asylum) be too much to ask? Also, guards do not respond to your actions in any kind of realistic way. Often your killing will go unnoticed by guards whose line of sight you should be in. But I’m not really complaining, because the lack of any real stealth mechanics would make trying to hide your actions from smart opponents completely unbearable. Wow, that was a backhanded compliment.          Now, the missions feel largely the same as ones from previous Assassin’s Creed titles, with a few exceptions. In particular, the missions where you get to pilot Leonardo de Vinci’s war machines are pretty cool. However, the new “100 percent Synchronization” mechanic, which provides an extra set of objectives for a mission, like “don’t get detected”, hurts the quality of all of these missions. It’s obvious that the intent of this mechanic was to provide a bit of extra challenge and to force the player to think about the missions in a different way. But, penalizing people for getting detected with a “50 percent Synchronization” when the necessary abilities do not get detected aren’t provided in the game simply isn’t fair. It just feels like padding, designed to make people replay memories over and over again. Oh, there is a restart memory function now, so now you can restart immediately after failing a 100 percent Synch! Fan-tucking-fastic.          The absolute best addition to the game is the assassin recruits. You can find people struggling with guards all around , and if you help these people, they will agree to work for you. You can then send them on missions in other countries (which play out simply as results of chance) and you can use them to kill people during the in-game action. Watching guards get iced while you walk by unnoticed never loses its charm. You can level up these recruits to, so they get better armor and weapons as well, so they will be more likely to survive.          Side activities can be found n the game as well. There is still a lot of city renovation, but now you have to actively go out into the city, find shops and buildings, and pay to renovate them. I never actively went out to go renovate shops, simply because I couldn’t be bothered. I did most of the renovation in Assassin’s Creed II because I could access all of it from one location. Again, making you actively hunt for buildings in the city to purchase feels like padding. There is a fast travel system and you can ride a horse in , but you have to renovate the former, and I never bothered, and the horses have lost their gallop function, making jumping around on rooftops faster than adhering to the streets on a horse. The previously mentioned Christina missions are light on gameplay but provide some of the best story content, and Romulus Shines have replaced the previous game’s Assassin Tombs as the game’s linear platforming areas. The shrines do still provide great chase sequences though. There are less assassination missions that you actually get to take part in this time around, but taking their place are Templar agents that can be found in the world that you get to kill. You also have to kill Borgia captains to release  from Borgia rule. Most of these side missions are… okay, but I never felt any real incentive to do them. In particular, the game never really follows through on the idea that you are actively working for the betterment of , so I never felt the need to hunt the Borgia Captains. I think the main reason I avoided most of the side missions was because there were constantly story missions available. In Assassin’s Creed II, when the story forced me to progress to another city, I would try to avoid leaving until I had completed some of the side missions. Because the entirety of Brotherhood takes place in , I always had a story mission available, and never felt the desire to slow down and see what else was available. The structure of the game is not conducive to making the player want to see the optional missions.          On the graphical side of things, the game looks mediocre. In terms of art design, it looks pretty good.  itself is pretty convincing, and the details in the city are cool. The character models o look better this time around, with Lucy in particular actually looking like a human, instead of some horrible fish thing. However, from a technical standpoint, the game’s engine is showing a fair bit of age. The framerate stutters often, and the drawing in of textures is still unbelievably terrible. In particular, shadows and entire trees will not be visible until your character is about  away from them. The absolute worst issue is the way the characters interact with one another and with their environments. It never looks proper. Characters are either clipping through one another or hovering around one another. Their contact never looks real, and same goes for their contact with environmental objects. Characters look like they’re hovering above the ground, and not lie they’re actually making contact with it. It’s not nearly as bad as games like Splatterhouse, but it is still unacceptable for a supposedly AAA title. The animation has its fair share of issues. The climbing animation looks fairly poor across the board, which is strange considering how often you’ll spend looking at it. (Comparatively, the combat animations are all pretty solid). Also, there is not animation for when Ezio or a horse walks on a rock or something that is slightly elevated from the rest of the ground, so instead we bear witness to Ezio or his valiant steed suddenly jerking upward and then back down. It looks dreadful.          Now, this is the first Assassin’s Creed game to include multiplayer, and let me tell you, it is fantastic. The object of the game is to stealthily kill your assigned target. You gain more points for fancier/stealthier kills, and the person (or team) with the most points at the end wins. Now, I know I complained about the lack of working stealth mechanics a few paragraphs back, but that was because the idea of walking through a crowd unnoticed doesn’t really work in the single player. However, in the multiplayer you take o the character model of the NPC, and it is quite possible to imitate an NPC and sneak up on your opponent. The multiplayer forces you to think like an Assassin, and choose when to be stealthy and when to rush your opponent. It’s so satisfying and unique, and almost worth picking up the game for alone.           The previous Assassin’s Creed title was a decent game elevated by great characters and art design. This game lacks the great plotline of the last game and the art design is no longer fresh, and as a result the gameplay flaws present in the series are more naked than ever. However, the multiplayer is so excellent that it almost transcends the shortcomings of the singleplayer game. Almost.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[    Just a year after the spectacular  ""Assassin's Creed 2,"" Ubisoft Montreal has served up an equal, if not  superior product, with ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.""    While the lack of an almighty and  legitimizing numeral in the title of this entry might suggest  ""Brotherhood"" is an offshoot, this is far from the case.    Instead, ""Brotherhood"" delivers a  fully developed story that takes place immediately after the events of  ""Assassin's Creed 2,"" as well as an ambitious multiplayer mode unlike  anything available today.    The player once again assumes the  role of both the modern-day assassin-in-training, Desmond Miles, and his  Resonance-Era Italian ancestor, Ezio Auditore, as Desmond attempts to  secure an ancient relic by reliving Ezio's memories through use of the  Animus.    While the overall scope of the  story and the terribly muddled final act may not stand up to the  magnificent set pieces of ""Assassin's Creed 2,"" the sequel excels in its  refinement of gameplay and overwhelming amount of content.     Most noticeably different from other entries in the series is the very Brotherhood for which the game is named.     Approximately a third of the way into the game, the player is given the ability to recruit members to Ezio's assassin guild.     These non-player units can be sent  on various missions to earn experience, money and tradable items or can  be called into action to assist the player directly.    This greatly affects the way a  player can choose to carry out an assassination, as it is the first time  in the series they are not required to strike the killing blow  themselves.    While the first two games had  three moderately sized cities each, ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood""  features Rome and the surrounding countryside.    Because of this, horses, which are  now allowed to go into the city, are incredibly helpful when outside of  Rome, but are cramped and unwieldy while in the city.     Players can also buy shops, banks and landmarks around Rome to receive discounts and earn a periodically deposited income.    Combat has also been changed through the inclusion of a small, but meaningful, tweak.    Although the parry and counter  system from ""Assassin's Creed 2"" returns, the player can now rapidly  press the attack button after killing an enemy to go into a chain of  instant executions with other surrounding opponents.     This is by far ""Brotherhood's""  most polarizing aspect, as it can be viewed as either an incredibly  satisfying addition or a game-breaking one.     As I tend to derive far too much  pleasure from seeing hoardes of helpless guards pile at my feet, I did  not take great fault with this addition but, at times, could not help  but feel ""Brotherhood"" was a tad too easy.     On top of the lengthy story mode,  Ubisoft Montreal has created a truly innovative multiplayer mode in  which players assume the role of competing assassins in various game  modes.     Across the modes players are  tasked with either hunting or staying hidden from their rival assassins  on a map populated by numerous non-player characters.     The result is a multiplayer that  encourages stealth and the emulation of typical NPC behavior by the  player to successfully evade or find their opponent.     Players earn experience points each round to unlock new abilities, weapons or character models.    Ubisoft has confirmed  ""Brotherhood"" will receive additional multiplayer maps and modes  starting with a free download pack in mid-December.     In a fourth quarter plagued by  pushed back release dates and futile attempts to recapture the fervor of  motion-gaming, ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood"" is a content-rich and  expertly crafted game that any fan of the series or non-traditional  multiplayer should experience.     This review is based on my  experience with an Xbox 360 copy of ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,""  which is also available for PlayStation 3.    Originally published in the Indiana Statesman. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I was a bit surprised by the two year gap between the original  Assassin's Creed and the second game when so many franchises these days  focus on the yearly schedule, but it didn't take too long for Ubisoft to  decide to annualize it. While II jumped the series forward in time a  few hundred years (for the bulk of the gameplay, anyway) and used a new  main character, Brotherhood is a direct continuation of that character's  story, with the added hook of a significant team-building element in  the single player and a multiplayer component as well. So in some ways  it feels like a secondary game just meant to make some money and remind  people that the franchise still exists before the ""real"" next one comes  out, but there are enough developments to the overarching plot and  additions to the standard gameplay that it's definitely deserves to  stand beside the other games as a legitimate sequel.  So Brotherhood starts shortly after ACII ended, both in Ezio's time and  in Desmond's. I thought the game might take place entirely in the past  since Desmond already got what he needed from Ezio's memories, but it  turns out there's still more he and the team need to figure out, so it's  back into the Animus he goes. They hide from the bad guys and he learns  more about the history of his ancestor. Due to predictable  circumstances Ezio doesn't lose all his ability but most of his  equipment is gone, forcing him to rebuild his arsenal as he relocates to  Rome. We got a small taste of that famous city at the end of the last  game, but Brotherhood lets you explore it fully, and it's the biggest  single location in the series. The scale of the games seems to have  curiously shrunk over time, with the first featuring three famous cities  and the connecting areas, the second including two major locations and a  few smaller ones, and Brotherhood having only the one significant  location. But it's varied and big enough for the game's purposes, plus  there's plenty of opportunities to revisit old locations for a bit.  The progression is similar to ACII for a while, as you discover the  plans of the enemy (this time the whole Borgia family) and make some of  your own to eliminate their influence over the city. Ezio's more  ambitious this time though, aiming to completely remove the Templars  from the city by buying out businesses and eliminating anyone of  importance who stands against him, and most significantly, taking over  the Assassin's brotherhood and building his own army of recruits. These  systems add a lot to the feel of the game without being too distracting,  as it's just a few minutes of navigating menus to maintain your affairs  and the recruits come with the benefit of being able to help you out in  battle as needed. All of these ideas are actually pretty simple in  execution when you really look at them, but they're robust and  interesting enough to make an action game like Brotherhood seem more  important than one man's quest for revenge.  They do a surprising amount on Desmond's side too, letting you see a few  familiar areas in a new light, bringing back ideas like snooping  through emails, showing you how his assassin training is really  progressing, and ending on a cliffhanger that left me both surprised and  anxious to see what happens next. In addition to the required stuff,  the optional content seems more considered this time. The secret puzzles  left by subject 16 are back, but in addition to that you can do things  like unearth some repressed, sad memories from Ezio's past and do some  extra assassinations a bit more complicated than the ones in the last  game. And of course there's the online, which doesn't seem to have the  biggest PSN community but was pretty fun in the little of it I managed  to play. You choose a character and try to track down another player  while the same is being done to you, and the constant cat-and-mouse  assassinating and balance between blending in and knowing when to use  your flashier skills are cool enough that you don't really care who  wins, just because it's interesting to screw around with.  There's not a whole lot new with the audio or video, with the voice cast  and familiar soundtrack returning and not too many graphical  enhancements. It's nice that you can get from one end of Rome to the  other without loading, and they at least managed to fix most of the  faces, making Kristen Bell's Lucy no longer resemble a human-fish  hybrid. There's nothing too exciting about Ezio's story for the most  part, and unfortunately the reason for most of the conflict in the whole  game is pretty poor. Despite the crazy conspiracy plot, the team has  been pretty faithful about honoring what the historical figures they  play with were generally doing at various points and when they actually  died, but the justifications for certain things seemed flimsy when a bit  of tweaking would have made it all make sense. There's no reason Ezio  wouldn't have killed some of these guys when he had the chance, so  having him randomly decide not to rather than creating a situation where  he couldn't just seems lazy. But otherwise I still enjoy what they do  with the story, and the modern stuff in particular was pretty good. They  do a good job of making all of the characters likable this time, and  that aforementioned ending is memorable and actually a pretty  significant bummer. I wasn't expecting the story to affect me the way it  did, and I guess that's worth noting. There should be another game  later this year, and whatever time period it takes place in, I'll  probably be enjoying it. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ With Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood being released just one year after Assassin's Creed 2, it was a concern how full of a package Ubisoft Montreal could deliver. Would it only add a couple hours of single player experience to fill up some side story? Would it focus all of its strengths on the new multiplayer mode? Was it just going to be a quick cash in off of AC2's success? Gladly and assuringly the answer to all of these questions is no. Brotherhood adds a new, fully fledged story complete with tons of side quests and varied missions. This in addition to the new and innovative multiplayer mode is clear that this is more than just a quick cash in. The game picks up exactly (and I mean EXACTLY) where AC2 left off. It also starts by giving a quick video recap on all the key events from the first two games for those who are new to the series, however for those who didn't play Assassin's Creed 2, they will still likely find themselves confused at times. The story in Brotherhood, as true to the Assassin's Creed franchise, is delivered in two distinct parts. First you have Desmond's story. This is what the main plot of the series is built around and essentially the stuff you will care most about in the long run. Desmond is once again strapped in to the Animus to try and solve him and his fellow assassins' modern day problems by revealing answers and clues through the eyes of Desmond's ancient ancestor Ezio . Ezio's story is one of redemption and resistance, in which you are fighting to free Rome from the reigns of the corrupt Borgia family.  The pacing in the story is truly great and is always good at knowing how to split up the missions during the story arc to leave you satisfied enough to stop, but still wanting more. Once you hit the last two hours however, the game grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go and you will find it impossible to put the controller down.  Welcome to the Animus        Fans of Assassin's Creed 2 will be glad to see the return of most of their favourite characters including Ezio and his family, Leonardo Da Vinci, Desmond with his troupe of modern day assassins, and a compelling new antagonist named Cesare Borgia. A lot more time is also spent during the story in getting to better know the other key Assassins and allies that make up the Brotherhood then was done in past games. You can go off and do various side missions for groups such as courtesans or thieves and you truly feel like you are strengthening and rebuilding the Assassin army.   The game is called Brotherhood for a reason and that is that during the game, the player is tasked at rebuilding the damaged brotherhood of Assassins and to bring it back to its true glory. Whenever you wish, you can go out searching for people on the mini-map to recruit that will aid you in your fight. And aid you they will with the help of the new game mechanic that allows you to use recruited Assassins to perform your dirty work. Don't want to blow a hiding spot? Think there are too many guards to take on by yourself? With just a tap of a button, your Assassin brethren will quickly swoop in and take any guards out for you. This gives an incredible sense of power that is truly unique to Brotherhood. Not to mention there is also a whole mini metagame where you can manage all of your assassins and assign them to various contracts and missions across Europe. This is done in a completely optional manner though, so those who don't like fighing their battles through the means of text pages can keep on stabbing dudes in the neck without ever having to worry about it. Whenever you call your assassins to help you or send them on quests, they individually level up and gain experience which you can then use to upgrade them. You have to be careful though, as if you send your assassins on a mission they can't handle, they will be killed and when that happens, they do not come back. Much stabbing to be done         Most of the gameplay in Brotherhood is pretty similar to Assassin's Creed 2, but they do add some other helpful new features. In the first two Assassin's Creeds, the technique that would prove most successful for fighting was to constantly wait for your enemies to attack and to then quickly counter them. Brotherhood has tried to promote some more offensive strategies by adding in a combo system where after a certain number of consecutive hits without interruption, every swing you take initiates an instant kill. When you're in a fight after slashing a guy a couple of times, this mode will activate and you will be able to quickly and easily take out everyone surrounding you. You will never grow tired of the pure feeling of bad-assery this will leave you with after you completely devastate a dozen guards in a mere matter of seconds. There aren't any other big noticeable changes to the gameplay, but the small changes they have made are slick and helpful. These include adding a quick travel system to quickly travel around Rome and expanding the ability of upgrading the city from just your small villa in Assassins Creed 2 to now the actual whole city of Rome.         Then of course there's multiplayer. Before AC: Brotherhood came out, trying to think of how a multiplayer Assassin's Creed game could work would only cause one's head to explode. But somehow they did it, and incredibly well mind you. The main game mode of multiplayer consists of you and 7 other players going around trying to assassinate one another. At all times you have one assassination target  that you're hunting after. You spend your time searching around the level for them with a compass that leads you to their general location, while at the same time trying to make sure that no one sneaks up from behind and assassinates you. This creates a unique feeling of paranoia when walking around as you never know who is going to be your assassin. The game tries to promote stealth gameplay by rewarding incognito kills with the most points. This way, people who are just sprinting around trying to be Rambo will likely lose. There also some other team based game modes, but nothing too noteworthy. It is certainly an excellent start to the online aspect of this series and really makes you look forward to how they can add on to it in the next installment.   Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is at its core an updated Assassin's Creed 2 with a new story and online play. Selling it off as bad because of this though would be doing yourself a huge disservice as although they may be quite similar, Brotherhood  changes a wide variety of details and nuances from Assassin's Creed 2 and ends up being an amazing product.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood may be not be leaps and bounds different then Assassin's Creed 2, however it still delivers an amazingly polished game and a great experience which will leave you cursing in italian for more when the credits start to roll.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Keep in mind, the Assassin's Creed franchise is definitely the one that made me  become a gamer. With a broad array of challenges, immersive gameplay and  an intriguing storyline, I didn't think the AC series could get better. Brotherhood takes the best elements of AC2 (advanced weapons and  controls, renaissance Italy setting and storyline) and layers on social  gaming elements in a seemless way. I've already lost one weekend due to this game, and I'm sure to lose  many more as more DLC becomes available. It's a great gift for any gamer who has a sense of history --  or any gamer without one.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Normally, I tend to scoff at gamers who say a game was a big disappointment. A lot of them expect the moon and even the slightest fault and the game is seen as inferior or not quite what they thought it was going to be. Every game (for the most part) tends to have its merits; its shining moments that break through the other idiosyncrasies the game can carry. So it was a good position I was in that I wasn't massively hyped for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the ""Assassin's Creed 2.5"" if you will. I absolutely loved the Assassin's Creed 2 enough to get all the achievements out of it but still, Brotherhood was something I'd definitely play but not something I was salivating at the mouth for. And yet still at the end of the 20-25 hour adventure, I was left with an emotional state closely resembling shock: ""did I really play something I should be loving but didn't? Did I do something wrong? This game can't be that disappointing, can it?"" Oh yes, it can.  After the ending of Assassin's Creed 2, many speculated on where the franchise would go from there. Would we see Medieval Europe? Or somewhere during the Industrial Revolution? Feudal area of Japan? Nope, instead we're going back to Italy and the further adventures of Ezio. This time Ezio, having his villa destroyed and uncle killed, flees to Rome to strengthen the Assassin's, and build up a strong enough force to counter Rodrigo Borgia and his son, Cezare all the while we see Desmond Miles in the present day uncovering more information about the Templars and the hunt for the Piece of Eden.  The main issue I have with Brotherhood is that it kind of feels like a side story rather then an essential tale. While certain events will undoubtedly be important in the franchise's future, the main plot itself is either confusing or just not that engaging and I actually took extended breaks playing the game compared to Assassin's Creed 2 where it was in constant rotation. One of the better elements of Brotherhood's storyline is some flashback missions that show Ezio's romance with Cristina, and while gameplay wise they're very straightforward, they told an intriguing part of Ezio's history that fleshed out what is otherwise a strangely bland character.   Now Ubisoft in making the 2nd game took a lot of criticisms about the first game and made not only a more improved sequel but an incredible game in its own right. They do add more elements to this game such as renovating Rome by re-building places like banks, tailors and blacksmiths, missions involving Da Vinci's ""war machines"" that were a ton of fun and there's a lot more side missions to do. It does feel slightly repetitive though: do things to gain more money so you can build something that'll generate more money but it was a nice goal to work towards. Not all additions are things I cared for and one of them is the optional requirement for getting 100% on a mission, fail and you only get 50%. Some of these range from kill the target using an air assassination, don't get caught or time limits. However, these can range from insultingly easy or some of the most infuriating or off-putting requirements ever. One was the common ""do not be detected"" one yet in some cases a guard will turn around at the last minute and stabbing would be a stealth kill and in other cases, just seeing you was enough to fail the mission. In many cases, I found I was failing for no reason and I'd be sitting there going ""wait....what? Why?""  Controls have still not been improved since Assassin's Creed 2 either. Many, many cases of Ezio not jumping in the direction you're clearly still holding down, the camera will swing around causing the direction of your jump to change, the basis for what can be grabbed and what can't seems strange and some of my favorite ones is where he'll sometimes magnetize to a ledge to grab it and other times he'll fly completely by it. The parkour is excellent as always though and the combat controls are simple enough (although the actual combat is also too easy or just not that fun). Presentation-wise it strangely looks...okay in places and gorgeous in others. One major annoyance is huge amounts of pop-in with trees magically coming to life or disappearing like Marty's hand in Back to the Future, textures on cliffs and distant buildings will fade in and while the draw distance mightily impressive, it's just not a stunner anymore like the last game was. Voice acting is good when it doesn't repeat itself all the time and one guard was stuck in this endless loop of ""let's show him the power of the Borgia"" that made me want to kill him even faster. Music, however? Absolutely spot-on and while some themes are recycled from the previous game, it's still a remarkable soundtrack.  The multiplayer is surprisingly excellent when it works right. Like Uncharted 2, Ubisoft adapted its parkour ""kill in stealth"" gameplay to multiplayer where you play as several characters with similar looking NPC's in the level and with the help of a radar and your keen eye, you have to discern which one's your target while also trying to avoid whoever is out to kill you. Matches can get quite intense and Ubisoft is having the appreciative mindset to give out free DLC such as new maps and gametypes. I don't know how long the community will last but we need more differing styles of online in games and Brotherhood offers a neat alternative to the headshot-wanting crowd of today.  While I am expecting it, I'm sure a lot of people will outright disagree with my review and I've always tried to be as brutally honest in these as I can and not try to hide the game's faults in a couple of sentences while spending paragraphs worth gushing over its triumphs. Like I said, I adored Assassin's Creed 2 and love the fiction and universe that they created but still, things can get a stumble now and then and Brotherhood for me hit too many wrong notes and at the end of my adventure, I really hated admitting to myself this game was a disappointment.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[This game reminded me of Assassin's Creed 1 all to much. I'm very glad I only gave it a rental, because it has the same flaws that have driven me to dislike this series. So where to start, well I'm always a big critic of the story lines in videogames, so lets go there. Story/Characters: Surprisingly I didn't hate the story in Brotherhood as much as previous games, while it was dry and rather boring, it was still imaginative at times and kept me entertained up until the end where I decided I was done with this series for good. Seriously no spoilers, but the ending makes no fucking sense and just fails so fucking hard.  The characters in Assassin's Creed have always been a point of UNinterest too. The voice acting is poor at best, they are far from interesting, and the story just drags them down too far for them to stand out from any well voiced videogame. Ezio in particular has always gone on my list of cunts in videogames. He's a very unlikeable character for me. The supporting characters drive me mad too, from the steriotypical paranoid british computer geek to the bitch of a hacker looking over your shoulder.   Gameplay: I hate it. Thats about all there is, in AC1 it was new and fun for the first few hours and then became mundane. Well by now its just become even more mediocre. While it does a good job of flowing it never impressed me, though I did get a laugh out of some of the finishers Ezio does. What it comes down to in the end is this: attack, block, counter. Over and fucking over and fucking over again. Thats it, thats all there is to say.   Graphics: Decent. I'll leave it at that. I'm not a huge critic on graphics, and these weren't the worst by any means.   Sound: Decent music for the time period, but nothing that drew me in. Soundtracks are a big part of games to me, which is why I enjoyed Mass Effect and even Halo's OST's they were original and very well made, while this kind of seems like it was put off and then thrown together from random poorly made movies.   Multiplayer:  Ok so fuck this, the multiplayer was good for five minutes then it got stupid. They had an interesting idea going in but it tanked bad and became highly frustrating. So don't even play it.   In the end Assassin's Creed Brotherhood earns a 2.5/5 because they should have quit after the second one and not made AC2.5 instead. It was a neat attempt and broadening the series it just failed miserably. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[If there is one thing Ubisoft can’t be described as, it’s slow. By using several different studios and hundreds of developers, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood was blasted out in 12 months. This short schedule surprised me considering the two-year gap between the first and second games and, to be honest, I didn’t really think a quick release would do the game any favors. I liked that Ubisoft Montreal took two years to polish and refine Assassin’s Creed II, and the change to flamboyant, colorful Renaissance Italy was a fantastic choice compared to the washed out, gray tenements of the first title’s Middle Eastern setting. Despite my worries about the game’s development cycle, AC: Brotherhood continues both Ezio and Desmond’s stories literally right after the last game. This continuation is made more exciting by a few key additions to the combat, but the level design, control, and mission parameters lack the same polish that made its predecessor so great.The triumphant return of Ezio and Desmond is easily the best part of Brotherhood. The story’s first act commences directly after Ezio’s conversation with the otherworldly Minerva. He plans to take a break from the assassin gig to get some T&A, but unfortunately the Borgias cut Ezio’s lady-killing act short. This Templar family of evildoers has come for the Pieces of Eden that Ezio repossessed. Despite his efforts to repel Cesare Borgia—Rodrigo’s son—the Auditore family’s fortress is destroyed and our garish assassin master must relocate Rome to end the templar rule. He plans to do this by liberating the city from the complete rule and intense corruption that has been inflicted. Meanwhile, Desmond is a real, playable character—at least more than he was before—and you can leave the animus at any time to play as him. Truth be told, there still isn’t much to do whenever you voluntarily play as Desmond; most of the important revelations in his story happen during the course of the main missions. The Truth puzzles make their sophomore appearances in Brotherhood as well, and while you could conceivably solve them on your own, you’ll probably have to use an FAQ for some of the harder puzzles. Even if you do have to cheat, it is worth it to get some more glimpses into Subject 16’s crazy, labyrinthine mind. Fans of the series will love the new conspiracy theories that seem to exist just to fuel conversations and forum threads, and the cliff hanger ending is unexpected and nothing short of astounding.Even with Desmond as more direct participant, this is still very much Ezio’s show. You’ll spend much of the game doing mostly what you did in Assassin’s Creed II: pursuing and assassinating smaller targets in order to pursue and assassinate larger targets. If you played the last game, you’ve done most of what is here before but there is one large new addition that is both a good and bad thing: Borgia towers. In order to gain support from the Roman citizens, you must take down these towers that are surrounded by guards and a captain. Devising ways to stealthily kill the captain is really fun and often very challenging. Once you kill the head honcho, the tower is open to burn down which will relieve the denizens around it and allow you to purchase shops. This functions the same as Monteriggioni did in the last game, with revenue slowly growing over time as you accrue more property. The only problem is that the massive Roman landscape feels less personal than Monteriggioni did. I never felt as if any of my renovated blacksmiths, brothels, or art trades were anything more than a cog in a money machine.Fortunately, destroying the Borgia towers does allow you to recruit assassins for Ezio’s cause. They can be sent on missions across Europe and Asia to gain experience and add to the assassin treasury, and while I ended up not caring about the money, sending my young greenhorns to cut their teeth on a Russian assassination plot sent my imagination whirling. After your recruits have some experience and an upgraded arsenal, calling upon them is both comical and useful. Once you whistle for them, they’ll often pop out of the nearest haystack to quickly eliminate the selected target. It is amusing from start to finish and alleviates some pressure you might have during a mission. Killing enemies by yourself is also made easier by execution combos, which allow you to dispatch enemies even faster than before. You start a combo by countering one enemy and then taking the momentum from that first kill through to other enemies. Essentially, it is a one hit kill combo that may sound over powered, but it makes sense because Ezio is a master assassin with several hundred kills under his belt. Another fun repurposing is the Romulus Lairs, which are just refined versions of the Assassin Tombs from AC II. Running through all of these catacombs heavily reminded me of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and a significant bonus is given for completing them all.Unfortunately, these slick additions and refinements fail to compensate for several key issues. Brotherhood has more instant fail missions than the first and second games combined. If you are detected just once—and Borgia guards often manage to scream bloody murder just before you shank them, alerting all their friends to your presence—many missions kick you right back to the last checkpoint, loading screen included. This punitive design wouldn’t be unbearable if the game also didn’t have some weak platforming to compound it. Ezio just doesn’t control quite as well, and many indoor sections feel like they weren’t play tested. I often couldn’t see where to jump next which meant a lot of blind jumps. And even when I could see the next jump, Ezio sometimes would opt for a face plant six stories down. I got the feeling that certain areas were designed by another studio and weren’t revised before the game went gold. Assassin’s Creed II was such a comprehensively refined experience that it really sticks out when Brotherhood doesn’t meet the same established quality. It isn’t a deal breaker by any means, but it makes me wonder what six months more development could’ve done for this game.I don’t want to sound completely down on the game because Brotherhood is not a failure. Hell, just continuing the storyline is a great reason to pick this game up. If you are a fan of the series you’ll be sucked back into the canon immediately, just be warned that actually playing the game can be tedious and it doesn’t exude polish like Assassins Creed II. What I really hope is that the next game—which is slated for a release sometime between late 2011 and early 2012—gets enough development time to match the series’ high polish mark. After playing Brotherhood though, color me worried for the future.Note: I did play some multiplayer, and I’m happy to say that it is pretty fun. The customization helps out the basic multiplayer modes, which are quite exciting on their own. I still view this series as a single player one, but there is a lot worth seeing in this game’s competitive mode.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ There was a lot of rumor leading up to the games release that this would be a  multiplayer centric chapter in an otherwise entirely  singleplayer focused franchise.Thankfully this is not the case and while the game does include a fairly enjoyable  multiplayer experience, it is but a small piece of a fairly sizable puzzle. Assassins Creed: Brotherhood is a direct continuation of the last game.I  don't think I'd recommend playing this without having played it, though  you could read up the plot on a wiki I think you'd be better served  actually experiencing Assassins Creed 2, which is still a fine game in  it's own right.If you've played the last game you should feel right at home, though some changes have been made for the better.The combat has been streamlined somewhat.In  previous Assassins Creed games you'd wait for a dude to attack you,  counter to kill them and then wait for the next guy to have a go at you.  You'll still be doing a lot of countering, but if you press the attack  button right after you've taken down that first attacker you'll  immediantly  take down the next nearest foe. And if you press it again, you'll take  down the next. And so on. And so on. You string your executions together  in order to take down large groups pretty quickly.If you've played Batman:  Arkham Asylum you'll have experienced a similar mechanic.It's pretty satisfying.Perhaps the other big change is the idea of the Brotherhood.A  little ways into the story you'll have the chance to recruit folk to  your cause, who you can train as Assassins by sending them out on  missions which  acrue  XP for them and money for you. This is all done by a handy menu.Recruits  also have a more practical application in the field, you can call them  in to take out foes for you - though this ability has charges. It never  the less makes you feel like a  bad ass  when you call in a dude to come in and stab the shit out of guys for  you. You can have a total of three charges and when you have three  charges you can hold down the button, so rather then calling in a dude  to kill a dude for you - they'll just rain arrows in on the area,  killing pretty much every guard on screen, which can be handy.I don't know what else I can really say.I like me some Assassins Creed and this is more of that.Between the engaging, lengthy campaign and the  multiplayer face and neck stabbing enthusiasts have plenty to be excited about.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I enjoy the Assassin's Creed games.  I don't love them, but I don't hate them, and I generally think that there are a lot of things that they do well, on top of a lot of things that are maybe not so great.  Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is more or less a continuation of that, but I have to admit that it is one of the most well executed and complete packages that has come out of this monster franchise.  Brotherhood further continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, everyone's favorite street rat turned assassin in Renaissance Italy.  I say that Brotherhood continues Ezio's story rather than Desmond, who is technically the protagonist of the AC series, because there is very little storytelling from Desmond's viewpoint.  This isn't really a terrible thing, because I've never really cared too much for the modern day characters, but it does make me feel like this whole game is just trying to ride on the success of AC2, and doesn't really fit into the overall plot outside of the final sequences of Brotherhood.  Probably the most frustrating story point for me was the fact that Ezio so quickly seems to forget about the end events of AC2, which I would imagine would have been pretty startling.  Regardless of the reason, in Brotherhood you take control of Ezio yet again as he relocates to Rome, and Rome is where basically all of the game takes place.  The city is vibrant and beautiful of course, and just moving around the city is still fun and simple to execute.  Of course, you start the game as a skillful assassin, and you only gain more abilities as the game progresses.  Brotherhood culminates in Ezio being a veritable whirlwind of death, even more so than in AC2.  This is still mostly due to the difficulty of the AC games, which is laughably easy, but as much as I know that it takes no skill whatsoever it can still be fun to obliterate a group of 20 armed soldiers without breaking a sweat.  Probably the biggest gameplay additions in Brotherhood are the assassin's guild mechanics.  You can recruit new assassin's to your guild and call them to aid you in a fight, and they will level up the more you use them.  They can also level up by you sending them on various missions around Europe, but it won't take you long to have a full guild of max level assassin's, at which point all the leveling mechanics are rendered useless.  It never really gets old to call an assassin on a guard, and watch as your lackey leaps from a rooftop to take down your target.  Brotherhood is not a short game, as it probably ran me 30 or more hours to complete.  Since it is open world in nature, obviously it could be done much faster if you stuck only to plot missions, but I still think it is a sizable adventure with a large cast of characters in a city with many different areas, both obvious and hidden.  The size of the single player adventure and the short time between AC2 and Brotherhood make it all the more impressive that Ubisoft also managed to include a large, functional multiplayer mode that is honestly unlike anything I've ever seen in a video game.  The main mode, called Wanted, puts 8 players in a map full of wandering NPCs and tasks them with tracking a single player target while avoiding anyone who may be hunting them.  It is a clever game of cat and mouse, and players have to decide whether to try and blend in with the NPCs or go for their target quickly.  With a leveling system that gives new abilities, some neat maps, and other modes, the multiplayer is not only robust but is actually quite fun.  I'm very impressed with what they were able to accomplish for a game that does not seem like it would adapt well to multiplayer at all, and am generally pleased with the single player mode, even if it is nothing particularly special or new.  If you are one of the millions who loved Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood is probably a must buy, and even if you only kind of enjoyed AC2, Brotherhood is still a fun game and a very complete package.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[  Da Vinci’s Disappearance is the first DLC for Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood. The single player portion of the DLC takes place in 1506, a year before the final confrontation with Cesare Borgia. The Hermeticists, a cult whose ultimate goal is transforming mankind, kidnap Leonardo Da Vinci in order to uncover a secret that would secure the cults status with more power. Ezio attempts to find Da Vinci by tracking down the masters works of art, which supposedly have clues to his secret. The story is the best part of this DLC. It features 8 new missions that showcase previous formula missions from the main game. While other expansions in the franchise offered experimental new abilities (like flag pole bending) to Ezio’s repertoire, this DLC offers no new tricks for the formula. The game play has a solid backbone and offers a variety of mission structures that we had come to expect. Without reveling too much, there are also a few cameos from other characters in the franchise and its very rewarding to see their return. The time it took me to beat this DLC was 2-3 hours and the ending gives possible clues as to locations you might visit in the sequel.    What Da Vinci’s Disappearance fails at is its multiplayer portion of content. The content itself is substantial, featuring four new personas, 1 new map, 2 new game types and exclusive bonuses that were received via preorder or collectors bundles. I personally think the multiplayer of the main game is fantastic and more people should give it a try. It truly is something unique and the amount of strategy involved is impressive. I actually played so much that I hit level cap in a matter of months. The escort game mode is interesting but not the show stealer. The new Assassinate mode is difficult but once you get the hang of it, the mode becomes a big star. The new map Alhambra is aesthetically, a Muslim palace in Spain and offers multi leveled crowd zones. As of now I have said mainly good things and yet I started off with how the Multiplayer fails. Why?    As I said the content is not the problem but the rather the execution is. Unlike previous updates and having exclusive content, this DLC aggressively segregates the gaming communities from the haves and the have-nots. If I want to host a party to search for games, any person who doesn’t have the content will not be allowed to join. This also includes custom friendly games. If I am in a friends party and I get to choose the character I am unable to have our team play the new characters. When multiplayer had to deal with people who owned the Officer and Harlequin persona's, they simply only allowed the player that had bought the characters to have the option to choose. This means that one cannot show the new content and must rely on others to host the game instead.   Furthermore they new game modes are thrown in without giving any considerable training on how to play them. Overall Da Vinci’s Disappearance is a must buy for anyone who hungers and enjoyed the main game. If you are solely purchasing this DLC for multiplayer content I advise you to make sure that the normal teammates you play with are also on board. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ If you’re familiar with the Assassin’s Creed   series, you’ll probably remember that the first game was… divisive.   While the premise of the game was enticing, some found that the   execution was lacking. Complaints of repetitive quests, not enough   content, and a generally disappointing presentation compared to what was   promised left a lot of people closely watching the game disappointed.   With the release of Assassin’s Creed II, it seemed that Ubisoft   had taken the criticism of the first game to heart. The general   consensus being that the sequel was a marked improvement over the   original in every way, but still had imperfections. About a year after   that, Ubisoft released Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood. Because Brotherhood followed so quickly on the heels of Assassin’s Creed II, there were accusations of the game being a cheap cash-in. While Brotherhood   does re-use assets and game mechanics from AC 2, it’s an improvement   over the previous entry. The multiplayer, alone, stands as one of the   best, most original ideas this generation and might be worth the cost of   admission.     Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood  continues the story of lady’s man Ezio Auditore, the main character of Assassin’s Creed II . Brotherhood  picks up the instant that AC: 2   ended: Ezio, having punched-out the Pope himself, has liberated the   Apple of Eden (a ancient device used to create religion, among other   things). Since clocking the Holy Father stands among the pinnacle of   achievement for some, Ezio decides to retire back to his family’s estate   in the Italian countryside, ready to fill his calender with crazy   parties until the end of time. But Cesare Borgia, sworn enemy to Ezio,    has other plans for our young Cassanova. Cesare’s army sieges and   eventually destroys the Auditore estate, stealing the Apple of Eden, and   leaving Ezio fleeing to Rome with little more than his raw sex-appeal.   Now, Ezio decides, is the time to build up the Assassin Brotherhood, and   reclaim the apple.      Rome, in Brotherhood ,   is spectacular. It’s among the best digital representations of a   “living city”. From the painstaking recreation of  Italian renaissance   fashion, art, and architecture, to the little things, like bards running   up to Ezio with lutes in-hand, only to have them rudely knocked out as Mr.  Auditore pushes the annoying little bastards aside – it’s evident that Ubisoft put a lot of love into Brotherhood .   The city becomes a playground as Ezio runs around finding several   different kinds of collectables, subverting the influence of his hated   enemy, the Borgia, and completing missions for different factions and   NPCs (Leonard DiVinci, amongst them). At any given time during the   single player, you’ve got at least a dozen or so missions open for   completion, each part of their own storyline, which contribute to the   story overall.     In fact, there’s almost too much to do in Brotherhood .   And not all of it feels meaningful. For instance, you can renovate   shops which earns you money, which is basically only spent on renovating   more shops. And as you form the Assassin Brotherhood, you can send your   underlings out on missions, which would be awesome, but you don’t get   to participate or watch them complete their tasks in any meaningful way.   Sending Assassins on missions boils down to you fiddling around in   menus every few minutes. Sure, your Assassins level-up when they   complete contracts, but whatever level your underlings are has no   meaningful effect on the game world. In short, much of it feels like   busy-work.     If   you’re the kind of person who absolutely must finish everything in a   game before moving onto your next one, prepare to spend a lot of time   with Brotherhood . I’ve   completed the main mission and have finished about a third of the   side-quests, and I’m about 37 hours in. Overall, the single player is   incredibly polished. Sure, there are some reused art and assets from the   last game, but even if you played AC 2 to death, you’ll still enjoy   yourself here. Also, if you liked the ending of AC 2, Brotherhood’s ending is every bit as crazy.    There’s also multiplayer in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood . It’s nothing short of awesome. Brotherhood is   easily among the top multiplayer games this generation. However, if   you’re looking for a run-and-gun, kill him before he can react game,   keep looking. Brotherhood is no Call of Duty . This game plays much slower, but no less intense.     To give you an example of Brotherhood’s  multiplayer,   I’ll tell you about my favorite mode: wanted. Ostensibly, it’s your   basic free-for-all deathmatch. In wanted, you’re on your own against up   to seven other players. Every player is given a “contract”, which is   another player they have to find and kill, but there’s a twist! At the   beginning of a match, every player picks an avatar. This avatar is then   duplicated throughout the map and controlled by AI, creating several   dozen copies of every player in the match that move, react, and   generally wander around the city-scape as a player would. Your job,   having a contract to kill your target, is to find out which NPCs are   dummies, and which one is the player you’re hunting. Once you’ve figured   that out, you get to split you target’s skull in half with an axe, or   slice their neck with a straight-razor. Get it wrong, and you lose your   contract, negating any points you could have earned for the kill.    Keep in   mind that another player, or sometimes multiple players, will have you   as a target. As you’re stalking your pray, chances are someone isn’t far   behind  waiting for you to reveal yourself by doing something an NPC wouldn’t  do   (for instance, hopping around on rooftops, or killing someone). This   makes for very intense games of cat-and-mouse where you’ve always got an   eye behind your back, watching for any strange movement. The potential   for mind-games and misdirection are practically limitless, creating deep   strategy for the game – also it’s ridiculously fun.    You’ll   receive points based on how “skillful” your kill is. That score is   determined by how stealthy you were approaching your target, and what you   did to land the final blow (for instance, you’ll get a bonus for   waiting in a haystack, and then jumping out as your target walks by,   pulling them back in with you). Conversely, if you think someone is   following you, you have two options for escape:    run or stun.  Successfully  doing either earns you points and your pursuer loses their contract on you,  denying them points.      Running works whenever you can manage to do it . It’s your best option   most of the time, but it isn’t easy. Once you start sprinting around,   you’ve effectively revealed that you’re not an NPC, and become an   obvious target. Stunning, however is another beast entirely.     As you   start to play online, you’ll probably wonder why stunning your pursuer   rarely works. You’d be surprised to learn that’s the intent. Ubisoft   takes the position that Brotherhood    should be more about cunning than reaction speed – meaning you’ll need   to get the drop on your pursuer if you want to stun them. If every   encounter turned into “who can push the button faster than the other   guy” it would ruin the mood of a Brotherhood match.   Understandably, many people are turned off by the perception that they   aren’t able to directly defend themselves. However, I think it’s one of   the many things that makes Brotherhood    great. Because stuns only work under very specific conditions, a player   is forced to be smart when eluding a pursuer.  And make no mistake –   the multiplayer in this game is all about intelligence.      If ever you were to play an Assassin’s Creed game for the single-player, Brotherhood   is what you’ll want. It’s an improvement upon its predecessors in every   category, and it’s just plain fun. It has its small problems, but   they’re nothing that should keep you from enjoying yourself. If you’re   looking for multiplayer different from the shooter-of-the-month, you   absolutely need to play Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood.   The multiplayer on offer here is deeply satisfying and unlike anything   that has come along this generation. Simply put: you owe it to yourself   to play this game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Ubisoft seem to be fast becoming my favourite company, with Assassin's Creed becoming my favourite franchise. I'm not normally a fan of sandbox games: I follow story progression and tend to miss out on side-quests and collectibles. None of this is true for the Assassin's Creed games. I do have them all, granted a bit later than most big fans, but that doesn't mean I think any less of them - just that I can't afford new games when they're new.  While being a new game, Brotherhood doesn't have many huge differences from Assassin's Creed II, and that's it's biggest strength. While there are many differences in parts of the game, the developers have obviously realised that their previous game was good enough to not require a complete overhaul. That said, they have changed a few things, mostly for the better. The biggest of these obviously is the multiplayer mode, although having not played this I'm not going to include it in the review, only mention it as one of the improvements. Having played through the rest of the game I can't call it anything else, as nothing seems to have suffered to include it.  Other improvements include the ability to replay memories, and my personal favourite: the ability to recruit new Assassins. This new gameplay mechanic allows you to ask citizens of Rome who've been hassled by the Borgia to join you, allowing you to send them on missions, and call them into battle when your stuck. Using an experience system you can level them up, equip them for battle, and bring them fully into the Ranks of the Assassins Guild.  All is not perfect with the game however, as some things seem to be amiss. For me, the biggest problem is the lack of actual assassinations to be performed. While the first games had you building up to a proper target in each series of events, there only seem to be a few true assassinations in Brotherhood. There are several kills to be done, but what really made a mission for me was the chat with the target after you had successfully terminated them, which only happens a couple of times in Brotherhood. Another feature I've found quite interesting is the integration with Project Legacy: a Facebook game which allows you to connect to your XBOX game to achieve some further extras. Through playing this text-based RPG you can earn experience for your assassins, and unlock extra clothing options. It's very simple, and far from necessary to the game, but is a very nice and unique feature. Despite the lack of kills to be done, the game plays really well, and is hugely enjoyable. Unlike the previous 2 I have yet to get all the achievements, and sadly due to the multiplayer mode quite possibly never will. I've not come across any bugs in the game, and played it through very happily. I'd highly recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the earlier iterations of the game, but if you weren't a fan there's not a big enough difference in this game to make you fall in love with it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Great game, fun, great campaign.

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Single-player review. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is a direct sequel to 2009’s Assassin’s Creed II. The game literally takes place moments after the ending of Assassin’s Creed II. Players familiar with the Assassin’s Creed franchise will notice immediately that the core mechanics of the game are largely the same but with the addition of more abilities and features. Players will still use R1+X to scale walls or R1+square to initiate counter-attacks and so on. This game is pretty much the Assassin’s Creed II players remember. Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing since Assassin’s Creed II was such a fun game to play.  AC: B has the player resume their roles as assassins Desmond Miles (when in the present day of 2012) and Ezio Auditore Da Firenze (when in the Animus). The plot of AC: B focuses around Ezio who is attempting to rebuild and reclaim Rome from its Borgia rulers. The story does a good job of fleshing out details about characters you have already been introduced to in ACII while introducing some new characters along the way without having the player feel swamped with information in any way. The plot of the game is- in true Assassin’s Creed fashion- full of twists and surprises that will keep you entertained from start to finish and it is easily one of the game’s strong points. The first thing players will notice when they resume Ezio’s story is that the combat in AC: B has been sped up significantly: enemies are now more aggressive, taking shots at you more often and at the same time players have the ability to perform an execution move (which basically reduces the number of hits it takes to kill an enemy with each subsequent kill a player can get without being interrupted by an enemy attack) which further speeds up the pace. Also worth noting is the pairing of certain weapons which can be used simultaneously such as the sword and gun combo or the dagger and throwing knife combo which gives an extra layer of depth to the combat. Complementing these new tweaks is an expanded arsenal which includes weapons such as crossbows and heavy weapons. Though the faster pace and new abilities may take some time to get accustomed to, the combat is able to remain just as satisfying and fun to watch as it was in the previous instalments without feeling repetitive. One of the biggest additions in AC: B is the fact that this time round Ezio can recruit other Assassins and utilize them to help him on his missions or just straight up help in engaging enemies. These Assassin recruits can level up and gain points which the player can then spend on improving the quality of gear the recruits work with. While certainly a great addition and a fun mechanic to play with, its full potential is not realized as most story sequences disables the ability to call in Assassins often making you wonder why this ability was even implemented in the first place if not to be used in missions. This is especially disappointing towards the end game where players are thrown into multiple large-scale battles without the ability to call in the recruits. Another departure from traditional Assassin’s Creed setting is the fact that players will spend majority of the game in the large, well-realized city of Rome instead of having several smaller locations to visit. As a consequence players will now have to conquer territories from the Borgia and renovate these liberated parts of Rome instead of having their own personal town to renovate. Strangely the routine task of destroying a Borgia tower to take over a piece of land and renovating the shops in said piece of land is really satisfying and the incentive of more money from more buildings renovated adds to the already rewarding experience. Besides increasing your income, the buildings and shops you renovate can also be used to purchase various items from basic items like medicine to more permanent items like armour and so on. AC: B is far from perfect and contains many of the flaws the original game had such as clunky platforming controls in tighter areas or pairing these clunky controls with sequences which are timed; all which can lead to a great deal of frustration. Of course if you are familiar with the franchise then chances are that you have already learnt to forgive these minor annoyances. However the new large scale map of Rome does introduce some new problems which are not as easy to forgive. Firstly the overview map does a very poor job of telling you where you can and can’t go. Often exploring players will find that they ran/rode all the way towards a location just to have a white wall restricting the said location’s access - the game’s way of telling you that you should not be in that area just yet. This would not have been such a problem if players had some way to see the areas they cannot enter but unfortunately the ability is not included and travelling all the way to a location just to be blocked by a white wall is just a horrible waste of time. Another result of having larger and richer areas in the game is that the camera angles can easily get obscured. This is especially true when engaged in combat where the combat camera can get blocked by trees or buildings. While not exactly game breaking, this minor annoyance can stack up with the game’s other problems causing even more frustration. Overall the game’s problems boils down to one fundamental issue: the game controls do not work well for timed sequences. There are just simply too much mistakes that can occur in the platforming when faced with the pressure of time limits. Fortunately for AC: B there are only small traces of where time is a factor and an even smaller part within this group of missions which are compulsory in order to progress the game’s plot which is enough to allow players to enjoy the game rather than be frustrated. All in all if you are an existing fan of the Assassin’s Creed franchise or are just looking for a good and fun action game with an excellent story then this is a game you should play. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is basically a really fine-tuned and improved version of Assassin’s Creed II that continues the Assassin’s Creed plot in interesting new ways.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ Assassin’s Creed is a perfect example of seeing developers learning and refining their game with each iteration. The jump from the original to AC2 was incremental to say the least, and Brotherhood is a total refinement of the improvements they made in that game. That does however, make Brotherhood a little less impressive than its predecessor was and makes the core mechanics which the game is built around age quicker than they would otherwise.  The biggest draw in Brotherhood is the story, seeing the further development of Ezio’s character as he accepts the increasing amount of responsibilities that he must take on. The game picks up literally on the final note of AC2 and wastes no time getting straight to the point of the game. You have an entire new city to explore (Rome) and it looks simply beautiful. The odd person or building can look pretty rough around the edges, but it’s really hard not to lose yourself in the world.  Getting around said world is much easier this time, you can now call for a horse whenever you want and ride it through the streets. Which admittedly can be awkward, but is still much faster than walking or climbing over buildings. There is also a fast travel system in the form of underground tunnels, these need to be unlocked by burning down Borgia control towers and are dotted around all over the map. The Borgia towers are a nice addition as they add in some combat sections to the viewpoint synchronisation. Which is still one of the best things to do when you’re not stabbing dudes. There’s also a plethora of shops for you to buy and renovate to increase your income, this is a good system, but it doesn’t take long to net serious cash and makes supplies rather trivial.  The dungeons also make a return from AC2, but take the form of sub missions. They manage to combine a good variety of the games mechanics and even make better use of them than some story missions. Some of which do feel more like side missions that are there to simply pad out of the game time, but there’s not enough of these to considerably lower the quality of the experience.  There have been some slight improvements made to the combat in Brotherhood, most notable of which is the kill streak system. By successfully executing an enemy, you can target another during the animation and immediately kill them afterwards. This can be done for as long as you pull it off (or there are enemies present), but the un-responsive controls take away a lot of the fun from this addition. The climbing is exactly the same as it was in AC2, but the system feels decidedly more erratic than before. Especially seeing as there are several sections where rapid direction changes are required, something which the system cannot handle very well and often results in frustration. The combination of these two main problems is largely why Brotherhood feels a little dated, they are by no means game breakers, but they certainly highlight the area in which the game is severely lacking in comparison to what others have done in the genre.  Multiplayer has found its way into the Assassin’s Creed franchise with this instalment. I didn’t get much time with it simply because I couldn’t find that many games. That being said, what I did play was pretty refreshing, it has a much slower pace than the vast majority of other multiplayer experiences. Taking a slow approach to assassinating your target has the biggest reward and acting like you’re supposed to be an A.I. character is much harder than you might think.  Brotherhood is not going to change anyone’s mind who doesn’t already enjoy Assassin’s Creed, the core gameplay is still the same and the story and setting are easily the biggest attractions. Brotherhood undeniably makes less of an impression than AC2, and that is really what makes the game age because there has only been a year between the two. That being said, if you enjoy what Assassin’s Creed offers, then there is no reason you shouldn’t play this latest instalment. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is effectively a sequel to Assassin's Creed 2. You play as Ezio again in the animus parts and Desmond in the present day scenario, and the game picks off directly from where Assassin's Creed 2 leaves off. The story begins with Ezio returning to his villa, but events quickly conspire to drag him back into his battle with the powerful Borgia family while in the present day Desmond and Lucy attempt to foil the modern day templars. After the initial events of the game, we go to Rome where the whole game effectively takes place. This may sound limiting but Rome is a stunningly recreated sandbox for players to enjoy, and is easily the largest city in the AC series till this point. The strong cast of AC2 return in the main, and some new characters are introduced. Ezio, Catherina, Lucrezia and Machiavelli are the high points of the cast. The story in Brotherhood is a well told tale but is a far smaller scope than Assassin's Creed 2's tale. It happens over a shorter period of time and unlike AC2 Ezio doesn't really change during the events of this game, he is already a matured character and his arch is effectively done. The villain does a good job being a villain and the events which Desmond and co go through in the present link back to Ezio's time but overall the story lacks the emotional impact that Assassin's Creed 2 had. However an amazing story mechanic that this game uses is the flash backs that you unlock to see what happened between Ezio and the love of his life, Cristina. These flashbacks are extremely rewarding to unlock and really help to flesh out the missing years from AC2. They are brilliantly integrated into the structure of Brotherhood and are my favourite part of the game. Gorgeous game, fast combat and horse jackingBrotherhood is a graphically fantastic game, continuing the series typically beautiful environments. Rome is possibly the best city created in any video game. Like other cities in the series, Rome has been recreated faithfully to its historical make up in the time the game is set. The buildings, historic sites and surroundings are all stunning and it all really helps to immerse the player in the games atmosphere. The character models are all animated naturally and they move and interact with each other and the player in a realistic way physically. The details on the environments and characters all looks great, especially on the main characters and the major buildings. The lighting is crisp and the graphics are some of the best on the consoles.  The sound maintains the quality of AC2. The music is beautiful, consisting primarily of period suitable music, and there are some great tracks towards the end of the game. The character voicing is fantastic, with suitable accents and actors for all the characters. The sound continuous to enhance and reinforce other aspects of the game without intruding into game play or taking over scenes. The environmental sounds are also great and help create the games ambiance. Inhabitants of Rome will chat with each other and the conversations are often amusing to listen to. Game play in Brotherhood is the same as Assassin's Creed 2. You climb a lot of buildings, and combat is based on the use of multiple melee weapons and a parry system. There are also some fun projectile weapons. The side missions this time include the use of some fun machines like Leonardo's design for a tank. These missions help to change up the structure of the game and are a fun escape. The games main quest missions are again quite varied, continuing AC2's escape from the repetition of AC1. The game is again a sand box for you to mess around in, and you have the freedom to explore the city at will outside of the main quest. A major change this time is that you gain the use of other assassins during the game. You can call them with the push of a button, resulting in up to 3 AI assassins jumping in to your aid. Its a really fun mechanic which makes the player more powerful and allows you to take on large groups of enemies on more equitable terms. Brotherhood also has a multiplayer mode, a first for the Assassin's Creed series. I was expecting the multiplayer to be a weak aspect of the game, but its actually unique and really well implemented. There are different modes, and many involve you having a target to hunt down while simultaneously avoiding your own hunter. Its a fun mode and really uses the mechanics of the series in a great and fun way to create a genuinely fun to play multiplayer. I ran into some matchmaking issues but once a game gets going its a blast.Don't mess with Harlequin onlineI have some serious issues with the structure of mission parameters in Brotherhood. De-synchronisation, I hope you like that word, because you will be seeing it a lot in this game. Many of the missions have arbitrary conditions which if not met result in the mission being forcibly restarted. This seriously pissed me off at points. One mission called the banker was particularly bad. The mission's premise is brilliant: stalk a corrupt cardinal through the crowds of a lavish party, hunting down and slowly planning out your kill. The problem is the target does not move and if a guard spots you its mission over. The game actually failed me AFTER I had killed the target because a guard had seen me stabbing him. THE MAN WAS ALREADY DEAD!! Immediately after successfully doing the mission you have to fight all the guards anyway, making these ridiculous conditions completely pointless. I felt that this really took away from the game as it added frustration and made some poor design decisions painfully obvious. The game also has some bugs and glitches. When I reached the last boss fight in the game I reduced him to half health and got a cutscene. After the scene I was unable to hurt him at all, and was forced to restart the section from the last check point. These bugs are not a huge issue but AC2 was near technical perfection so it was odd to see it in this game. I will put it down to shorter development time, but I hope that Ubisoft take their time with the next instalment of the series. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great game with a fun campaign and great environments. The multiplayer is excellent and tastefully implemented. The characters are great and the sound perfectly suits the game. However, Brotherhood falls short of Assassin's Creed 2 due to a lesser story which lacks the emotionally involving story of AC2. The game has some odd glitches and the mission parameters that result in de-synchronisation are infuriating and should be removed from this series AT ONCE. Ezio is still a bad assPros:Great graphics and lightingRome is fantastically recreatedImmersive atmosphereBeautiful music score which enhances the game experienceDesmond and the modern cast have been made more likeableThe mythos of the series gets deeper and advances in a meaningful wayThe flash backs to Ezio's relationship with Cristina are brilliantCatherina Sforza and Niccolo Machiavelli are greatMultiplayer is well integrated into the gameCons:Stupid mission parameters which cause instant de-synchronisation if failed, often for arbitrary reasonsSome control issues remainThe game has some bad glitches at rare pointsSome pacing issuesThe scope of the story is greatly reduced from the last gameWtf:Being seen as you are in the physical process of killing the target and de-synchronised as a result, when you end up having to fight you way out of the area after killing the target anyway.....Score: 7/10Needs less restrictive mission parameters and to polish out some glitches.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[The main problem with playing the         Assassin's Creed series on Windows rather than a console is that there isn’t really much effort put into translating to what’s available in that environment.  As with previous games in the series controlling        Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with a mouse and keyboard works, but still feels designed for a controller.  The worst offender was toward the end of the game where the unadjustable camera angle was such that you needed to run forward and to the right while making a jump.  With a gamepad, this meant pushing the stick to a corner while holding a button, but with a keyboard you need to hold down 3 keys at the same time.  The other main issue along these lines was menu navigation.  I found it impossible to navigate the DNA menu with the mouse because it would quickly scroll all the way to either end.  When using the quick travel points in the game, you get a menu of all the unlocked points with a map, but you can’t click the one you want on the map — you need to find it in the list and select it from there.  The final lack of integration with the environment I played this game in that limited my enjoyment was the achievements.  Every now and then the game would pop up a       Uplay achievement notification so it definitely has achievements but even though I bought the game through      Steam which supports achievements, Brotherhood’s achievements are separate.  I was actually unable to find a list of what I’d achieved on the Uplay site so really all I could get out of the achievements was when something popped up in the game.  Maybe there’s a way to see the achievements in the game, but when I’m in the game I’d rather actually play it.  On the other hand, the three friendly factions in the game (continuing from     Assassin’s Creed II, these are thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries) along with the assassins themselves offer challenges you can complete for certain rewards.  So that was sort of like achievements very tightly integrated into the game, and I completed almost all of them.  It would have been nice if there was an easier way to check my progress on them than having to dive deep into the DNA menu (while trying to keep the mouse still) or enter the faction’s hideout to look at the list on the wall.  Parts of the map unlock as you complete chapters, but there’s nothing in the story explaining why those map sections were locked or even notifying you that they’re no longer locked, much less explaining  why they unlocked.  It’s been quite a while, but I thought this made more sense in Assassin’s Creed II.  Maybe it’s because almost the entirety of Brotherhood is in Rome where Assassin’s Creed II spanned  four cities not counting the last mission.  I also frequently managed to kick dropped weapons great distances when stooping to loot the body that had just dropped the weapon, but that idiosyncrasy of the physics engine was more entertaining to me that immersion-breaking.  The high points of the Assassin’s Creed series for me have always been the story (who’s betraying who), the views, and the ability to do pretty much whatever I want.  Brotherhood does a great job of continuing these traditions — I found myself actually changing my mind multiple times as to whether a certain character was actually an ally as he said he was or if he was actually working against me.  The downside of the continuation is that many of the main characters are drawn from the previous game, including    Ezio himself.  The first   Assassin’s Creed had me play as  Altaïr and while I knew Brotherhood was continuing Ezio's story I was ready for a new main character.  While very similar to Assassin’s Creed II, Brotherhood was still just as enjoyable.  A major new point introduced in this game is a multiplayer mode.  I haven’t actually tried it out yet but it sounds like it supports a completely different play style than your typical deathmatch or even team-based play by giving you an assassination target who doesn’t know you are targeting them.   The single player’s major addition is the assassin recruits.  While it’s somewhat annoying sending them on missions since you simply choose them from a menu, it’s pretty cool to have a full set of top-level assassins at your command.  It’s odd that you can select the color of their robes  until they reach the top rank though.  I would have liked to see the recruits factor into the game a little bit more, but they are a very welcome addition! Overall it’s disappointing that I have to wait a significant amount of time after the console versions come out to get a version I can play on my computer that hasn’t even used that time to make full use of the resources available there, but the Assassin’s Creed universe is one I can easily lose myself in and the gameplay is plenty enjoyable to make it worthwhile picking up if you have a decent gaming rig but not one of the consoles which gets games from this series months earlier.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[This is now the third game in the Assassin's Creed series and I have stuck through these games so far mainly for the storyline. The overall arch that Ubisoft has developed here with a broad conspiracy theory spanning hundreds of years is incredibly engaging. Their ability to weave in details to actual history is nothing short of brilliant when you see it in play. This third game in the series keeps trading along with the same mechanics and gameplay that we have essentially seen for the past few years. The game is still a graphical masterpiece and the sites and sounds are again very well done. You do find yourself relegated largely to just one city (Rome) in this game and the story is well played out. The ending here is not as ground breaking as the second game, but it does seem like the developers were trying to match the surprise factor to only moderate success.Now part of the issue here is that this game is so iterative that it borders boring in some respects. All of the game play mechanics are exactly the same as the first game save for the introduction of the recruits this time around. That aspect is fun and it is a blast to see your ""army"" ride into the scene, jumping out of doorways, etc. Some of the other aspects from the second game took a turn for the worse though. In the previous game the upgrading of the manor was a fun and rewarding aspect. In this game you are left to a upgrade of monuments in Rome itself and unfortunately you don't see a lot of visual change in many of them. The final result is un-satisying and ultimately just not that fun.Almost all of the frustrations from the previous games are still here as well. Fighting takes forever, jumping occasional has you leaping to your death and climbing is sometimes just too slow. I am amazed actually in a series that sort of redefined the climbing and acrobatic genre, I found myself largely running through the streets of Rome rather than the rooftops.Overall so much of the game just felt too gamey. The treasures, the feathers, the side quests were all way too clearly laid out on the map. They all felt way to mechanical too. The Romulus quests for example always ended up being either a timed climbing event or a follow and catch the leader sort of thing. I think the formula is just getting a bit too long in the tooth at this point and I really want to see the Etzio story just come to an end.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[I really enjoyed Assassin's Creed II and this one improves upon everything, and I mean everything, in that game. If you liked that game, you will love this game. Notable improvements/additions are the Leonardo DaVinci weapon missions, the Assassin training system, the Borgia towers, and the improvements/renovation system. My personal favorite change that makes a huge difference is the kill chaining system whereby you can effortlessly flow from enemy to enemy while taking them down in style. It reminds me a lot of the recent Batman games and it works perfectly. Unlike Assassin's Creed II, the story to this game pulls you in right away rather than a bunch of filler missions at the beginning. I can't say enough good things about this - Ubisoft has a great thing going with this series. While I heard that Assassin's Creed Revelations was a step back, I'm still very excited to check out Assassin's Creed III.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[Glockstar Armani presents this game with 2 *GLOCKIE* awards for:*GAME MOST PERFECTLY SUITED TO MY TASTES**BEST GAME OF 2010*Seriously, I think that Ubisoft Montreal followed me around my entire life, deduced what kind of game would be perfect for me, and then they made that game and called it ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood"". Here are some of my favorite things in life: time-travel, Ancient Rome, Leonardo Da Vinci, cliffhanger endings, paintings with hidden messages, science-fiction, secret codes, chess, the Renaissance, political intrigue, medieval warfare, conspiracy theories, and video games with tons of gameplay where you can upgrade weapons and collect a ton of things. Ubisoft...you complete me.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[After celebrating all of the great things the first Assassin’s Creed did back when it first came out, and then having my jaw hit the floor at how much better Assassin’s Creed II was, My thoughts coming into this game were, “No way can they top the second one in any meaningful way.” Well guess what my friends, they have done the impossible. The improvements may not make your jaw drop as they did in 2, but Brotherhood still delivers a better experience. There is a lot of juicy depth to this title and that doesn’t even include the multiplayer which I have no interest in.We have here the same basic formula that was worked so successfully in the last two installments only this time they are laid out over an open world. That’s right no more transitioning from city to city, it all takes place in one extremely large city, Rome. This is the continued story of Ezio as he follows the Spaniard to Rome and further unravels what the Templar and Assassin orders are all about. Oh and the Desmond storyline is also advanced to make you scratch your head even more and yet still want to see where it all leads.So the improvements are plentiful in this package. The combat system has been further refined as the most exciting part, aside from counters being easier to pull off, is the kill chain combo system. Now if you are surrounded by enemies and you manage to kill you, you can string that into another instant kill to an adjacent enemy and continue that cycle for as long as you can without being hit or running out of nearby enemies. This greatly reduces those tedious and frustrating combat situations that where abundant in AC1 and persisted though less painfully in AC2. The climbing is also improved getting you to the rooftops faster and keeping you up there longer. In addition, the in game economy system is also improved offering extra stuff to renovate getting you more money fast.All of that is great but I have saved the best for last. On top of the guilds making their return (each has its own sidequest line by the way,) you get to found your very own Assassin’s Guild. You will never be alone again. Allow me to elaborate. Throughout the course of the game you will be able to recruit assassins in training. These valuable allies can be summoned to assassinate a pesky rooftop guard or aid you in an all-out fight. If you have enough recruits you can even summon a deadly arrow attack that will instantly kill all nearby guards. This is pretty awesome on its own but there’s more. Each trainee has a leveling system. They earn experience by assassinating enemies or by sending them on missions around Europe. As they level up they gain better armor and weapons giving you more powerful allies.Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is by far the best and most complete package of Assassin’s Creed for anyone who wants to see what the deal is. However, the brief review of the past games does a poor job of relaying just why events in this game are significant. Therefore, I would only recommend this title to fans of the series and perhaps people who don’t really care about story continuity, if such people exist. I for one thought they are all fantastic games and this one is no different. Much like every other ending, Brotherhood is a cliffhanger and I look forward to seeing how it plays out into the next installment.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[    In 2009, Ubisoft shocked the gamers of the world by releasing one of the greatest sequels of all time, Assassins’ Creed 2.   It was a huge, unexpected step forward in an industry that is riddled with lazy big publishers crapping out sequels like cheap toys rolling off of an assembly line.   It would have been borderline impossible for Ubisoft to one-up themselves again like that for Assassins’ Creed – Brotherhood.   It should come as no surprise to you then that this game, which came out only 12 months after II, is much more of a minor iteration than its predecessor.   It is still a fun game, but most of what is fun in “Brotherhood” was also in Assassins’ Creed 2.   There some good additions here and there, but they are still somewhat minor to the experience.   The biggest disappointment in the game, however, is in its story, which basically drags for the entire time and then ends on another cliffhanger without moving forward.       The strength of this game, and every other game in this series, is still the basic set of game mechanics.   75% of the time at least, you are still doing what you did in the first game -- flying across rooftops with the grace of a ballerina – perching atop a magnificent church steeple and enjoying a breathtaking view that stretches miles – making guards look like buffoons with your almost superhuman agility – stalking enemies, pouncing on them like a cat, and then scampering away up the walls before the guards can figure out what happened.   The engine is still very impressive, and the animations are tops in the business.   The first Assassins Creed gets its share of grief nowadays, but make no mistake, that game left behind some very strong DNA for its successors.   That strand of DNA formed the backbone for the superb Assassins Creed 2, and for the still enjoyable “Brotherhood”.      The single player campaign for “Brotherhood” has a ton of content.   If you had any fears that it was just a token add-on to a multiplayer game, those fears will be gone before you are halfway through with it.   There are tons of missions, both story-related and non-essential.   The RPG/Sim-ish elements from Assassins Creed 2 return, and have been expanded.   In “Brotherhood”, you can buy or repair literally hundreds of structures, buildings, and businesses to claim them as your own.   You can upgrade your armor and buy all kinds of artwork for your home.   In addition to tons of collectibles, there are now a few (pretty mundane) item collection quests that you can complete to unlock new items in shops.   Best of all, you finally get to visit Rome.   How could anyone not want to scale the Colisseum and take a great big leap of faith off of the top?    The biggest addition to Brotherhood is the ability to command other Assassins.   Throughout the game, you can help rebellious citizens struggling with guards.   When you save them, they join you in the Assassins’ Guild, and then you get to signal them to assassinate enemies.     You can also send them out of town to perform assassination missions for money and earn experience points. The whole Assassins’ Guild idea is a wonderful one, but it doesn’t add as much to the experience as you would have hoped.   Mission management is uninteresting and it feels like a spreadsheet.   There doesn’t feel like any compelling reason to send your assassins on a mission, other than to be a completist or get a little extra cash.   In real time, your assassins are somewhat overpowered, so summoning them almost feels like pushing the “win” button.   It is still fun to do though, especially when you are in some remote area and you see a cloaked figure climb a ladder and stab an enemy in the back.      The gameplay in this series is its strength, but it is also related to the weakness of this game – by the time that you get to “Brotherhood”, you have already spent 50+ hours counter-slashing guards, climbing buildings in brown and gray locales, and stabbing enemies in the back.   Even Assassins Creed 2, as excellent as it was, started to wear thin by the end.   Brotherhood is even worse in that regard.   In some ways, this game suffers from the ability of the previous games to provide so much content that you were getting sick of it by the end.   There just aren’t any improvements in the game that change the experience enough to solve that problem.   There are lots of new kill animations, but it doesn’t take very long to see them all.   There are a few interesting missions where you track down Leonardo da Vinci’s crazy inventions, steal them, and destroy them.   The missions have mixed results – some of them are fun, but a few of them are bad, and the hang glider mission is downright awful.   Adding to the occasional monotony is the annoying topography of the countryside.   Many times, I found myself trying to reach a nearby objective, only to end up on a five minute detour to get around an unclimbable obstacle.   This game would have benefitted from a GPS-style pathfinding function to make it less tedious.   The most unwelcome addition to the game has to be the return of the arbitrary, “insta-fail if you get detected” mechanic.   This is a downright infuriating feature that should have remained buried in the early oughts, where it belongs.   The stalking, sneaking, and assassination mechanics are still good enough to carry the game through its weak points.   Unfortunately, after a while, you almost forget while you are even doing any of it.   That is because the story sees virtually no development between the beginning and the end.   The Borgia are the enemies in the game, and most missions simply involve killing somebody who is supposedly important to them.   “This guy sympathizes with the Borgia – kill him.”   “This guy is sending out for reinforcements for the Borgia – kill him.”   “Kill this Borgia captain.”   “Kill this hooker who is passing secrets to the Borgia.”   By the end of the game, you will wonder why their whole family isn’t extinct.   After you finally get to kill the big boss, the big picture, modern day story finally takes over for the end.   After some suspense, you get nothing but a bunch of annoyingly cryptic dialog and a cliffhanger ending that explains absolutely nothing.   It didn’t leave me with a desire to play “Revelations”, as it feels right now like the whole “Templars vs Assassins” story is just being strung along.   Assassins Creed 2’s story of a young, brash man developing into a seasoned leader was great.   The story in “Brotherhood” is an outright disappointment.    Complaints aside, “Brotherhood” is still a pretty easy game to recommend if you enjoyed Assassins Creed 1 and 2.   The second game, especially, was so good that even a minor iteration on it is worth playing.   If you haven’t played it yet though, I recommend waiting for a while in between games, as all of them are long enough to wear out their welcome by the end.   These games don’t typically leave you wanting more, which makes me wonder how much longer Ubisoft can continue to make this an annual franchise.    ]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[If you haven't played Assassin's Creed yet you are missing out on an entertaining series. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the sequel to Assassin's Creed II so if you haven't gotten around to playing ACII yet, you probably should before moving on to ACB. If you don't care then ACB is a good enough game as any to start playing. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is pretty much like ACII but improves on the game in many ways.ACB takes directly after the events of ACII. Desmond and his chums are still hunting the Apple of Eden. They set up the Animus in modern day Monteriggioni and we see our old friend Ezio, the protagonist from ACII, in 1500 enjoying his prosperity. In the first game you rebuilt Monteriggioni, you leveled up Ezio, things are going great until Monteriggioni is attacked by Cesare Borgia, a crooked general and son of Rodrigo Borgia (the pope and villain from ACII). Monteriggioni falls, Ezio is wounded and wakes up in Rome. Here he starts from zero ready to exact vengeance on Rodrigo and to obtain the Apple of Eden from the Pope.Gameplay in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is remarkably similar to it's predecessor. You still assassinate people, go on missions, collect treasures, feathers and flags. A tweak from ACII is you can now ride a horse in the city. Also, the rebuilding aspect from the first game has expanded. In the first game you would improve Monteriggioni by renovating the buildings. In ACB you do the same thing except you rebuild Rome. You renovate banks, art shops, blacksmiths faction buildings and landmarks and doing so earns you income. This game adds another gameplay wrinkle which is why the game is named, “Brotherhood.” Let's just say that Ezio isn't the only assassin on the block anymore.ACB also marks the first game to include multiplayer, which is enjoyable. There are several game modes but most of them involve taking out a target. The game is kind of like a game of hide and seek. You have to hunt your target down and assassinate them. The person being hunted has to hide from their attacker. Everyone has perks, some help you hunt your targets and others help you hide. This game is a fun change of pace from all the FPSes out there and a worthy addition to the series.The graphics continue to improve from game to game. There is a noticeable refinement in the graphics compared to the previous games. Characters look better and the game runs smoothly most of the time. The whole game takes place in Rome, a huge open area, unlike the previous games that were divided, and there aren't really any load times since you can travel anywhere you want. There are load times if you do other missions and go to other areas but the game loads pretty quickly for the most part.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a great advancement for the series. The game is improved in every way. I can safely say that this is the best game in the series thanks to the new gameplay tweaks and the addition of multiplayer. If you could never get into the series this game won't change any minds but if you're a fan of the series you're sure to enjoy playing this game]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,"<![CDATA[ Yes, at the time of my writing, Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag has shipped for 360 and PS3. While all of those nice people get to enjoy it, I have to wait until the good ol' PS4 launch to play. Lucky bastards. So, instead I will review the third game in the series, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.Picking up seconds after the ending of Assassin's Creed 2, Ezio has just had his mind blown down in the vault. He didn't understand what he saw, and he seems to just want to forget about the vault. Except he left loose ends. The biggest loose end, was Rodrigo Borgia, the main antagonist of the previous game.Now Rodrigo has teamed up with his family to bring Ezio down. Which he does very successfully, resulting in major losses, personal and business wise for Ezio. Now Ezio plans to take down the entire Borgia family, get back the Apple they stole from him, and get revenge for everything they had done.This game's story is told in much the same way as Assassin's Creed 2, but not as well. The villain, Ceserae Borgia, starts off as a minor threat, before being completely diminished as he disappears into the game. Throughout the game Ezio is dealing with the Borgia, without really dealing WITH the Borgia. The final fight in the game is as disappointing as the last. At least in Assassin's Creed it was tough!The gameplay is also much the same, but a little better in some ways. The game feels bloated with content. From taking down Borgia towers, recruiting Assassin's, destroying Leonardo Da Vinci's war machines, and seeing flashbacks to an old love of Ezio's.This content is all well and good, but it just goes to show how boring the actual story is in these games, when I would rather be doing the millions of side activities at large. That isn't how the game should make you feel. The story needs to be gripping, and the events IN the story need to make you want to play it. Eventually, the only reason I was playing the story was to unlock the last Borgia towers, and then just to finish the damn thing.The Assassin Recruits were a good edition to the series. A very nice one. Leveling them up is addictive, but it is a pain in the ass when you have to sprint to a pigeon coop around Rome to be able to direct them. You can also level them down certain paths, but each path is balanced, because eventually you have to level them down the other path anyway.The combat has a new fun addition. Combo killing. It isn't like in Assassin's Creed where you had to do some sort of Dance Dance Kill type input. Now when you kill someone, if you hit the next person, you will kill them, and so on, and so on. It really improved the stale combat of the series, and I'm glad they included it.Overall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood isn't a bad game. It is just so much like its predecessor, that its hard to find a reason to play it, other than you really REALLY loved the second one.   ]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I've always thought of this series as a nice time-machine-like game where I get to explore and sort of experience what the world was like at the chosen time periods where their stories take place. They always seemed well researched with plenty of information that you could skip and dig into as much as you wanted. This entry is no different, as we're taken to 1700s during the American revolution where we are in control of Connor. But if you're reading this chances are you kinda probably know about the gist of what it's about, thanks to an insanely hefty marketing campaign by Ubisoft, so lets just get right to it.If you've played another in the series before, a lot of this will sound familiar. Most of the game still has you running around cities, this time in New York and Boston, where you are able to climb every where with plenty of optional things scattered around the map. You walk around, sync up with your sky-high-eagle points to reveal the map, and clean up the whatever objectives you choose. There are also collectibles, such as treasures, and feathers, which make a slight reappearance, and flying pages, which are new, that are collectibles which move that you have to catch. You can also partake in hunting, which has it's own whole system, or gamble with 1700th-century board games. Overall there's a lot of optional stuff littered around that adds quite a bit of value to the package. You could choose to do everything, or skip all of it and focus on jumping from one main quest to another; I found myself doing the latter near the end of the game. I was just really interesting in knowing what happens at the end.The campaign was mission based that allowed you to squeeze in a lot of optional stuff whenever you wanted to in-between. What I found myself doing was not using the fast travel very much (which by the way is much easier to access and get around with in this entry) and just running to my quest point while doing whatever I felt like on the way. I didn't really like the character of Connor. I felt like he didn't evolve or change at all and just got annoying. He's very determined to do what is just and right, and that's all he is the entire game. I remember the evolution of Ezio as a random womanizing boy, to a revenge seeking assassin, as something pretty epic, and I feel like the character development was lacking in this entry.I don't like spoiling story stuff, but the story was just weird. Still... weird.Traversing felt easier and I found Connor screwing up less than in previous titles. Although he still did at times, which is expected with games such as this, it wasn't happening as much as it was before. The introduction of being able to climb around in trees was very satisfying to perform as well.Combat still involves waiting for the first counter then chain-killing everyone. I still find it very satisfying even though it may sometimes be very simple. There are times where you have to disarm the enemy you are fighting first before being able to stab something into him, but that's usually as complicated as it gets. Most of the combat for me was done through these two methods, you have other tools at your disposal such as smoke bombs, and poison darts, but I found myself rarely using them.You are also able to call on assassin brethren to fight with you in battles. This has an entire system similar to the one introduced in brotherhood where assassins have levels, you send them to do contracts where they can gain exp and money in exchange for some time your assassin kicks it for like, ...2-10 minutes. There's also an entire boat combat system in there where you are a captain of a boat attacking others with cannons. A couple missions have you doing this, and I thought it was fun and done well.I played this on the 360, and the graphics were exceptional for the tech. There were noticable hiccups in frame rate, especially when going into eagle vision, but again with the age of the console this is expected and most of the gameplay was a smooth 25-30. Given the open world-ness I'd say that is pretty good. Cutscenes have good cinematography and feel very movie-like.Overall solid game mechanics that is well put together. Didn't care too much for the character or the story, which is the main deduction my score. It seemed like the game was trying to make some parts seem important but I couldn't really think of a reason to care. Still a lot of fun and definitely worth a playthrough, though.]]>"

Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I don’t think I’ve ever played a game that created so many conflicting opinions in myself that I’m left unsure as to what I actually think of it. Assassin’s Creed III is partially the best game of the series, and is partially a broken, convoluted mess that crumbles under the weight of its own ambitions. But believe me, those are some lofty ambitions that Ubisoft is chasing.The most obvious change to the game is that after three outings, we finally get a new protagonist and era to explore and slice and stab our way through. The new setting of Revolutionary War era America is perhaps the greatest strength. For once we are seeing the game play out in a setting that feels familiar, with many characters, themes and events that already exist in the player’s knowledge base. Though at the same time, it can be hard to swallow our protagonist, half-English, half-Native Connor, being inserted as a major focal point of events we are all aware of. It is much easier to buy Altair running around Jerusalem doing this and that, because we don’t have such an ingrained idea of the area during that time period. That being said though, this in-Animus story is easily the most elaborate and interesting story told in the series. The twists and turns that come from it make this adventure much easier to care about than any of the Ezio stories.For what it’s worth though, it is fascinating to traverse the landscape, seeing the new architecture and npc’s go about their lives while ducking out of the way of Loyalists and Patriots alike. The addition of wild frontier in which you can hunt and attack Templar Forts provide a real sense of scale and provide for a lot of side activities that can extend the playtime significantly. In addition we get to see Connor try and balance the line between his heritage and his duties as an Assassin to continue in his fight against the Templar threat. Racial conflict is not a major theme, but it’s nice that they acknowledged it somewhat, even if could perhaps be explored more thoroughly or seriously. An early scene shows Connor trying to blend into Boston under the guise of being a dark skinned Italian, all the while wearing skins and feathers. More thought could have made that conflict much stronger.From a game play perspective, there are both old and new systems that fill the adventure. Gone is the property investment and god-awful tower defense from the previous entries. New to the series is naval combat, town building and trading and a revamped assassin’s guild. The best of these is the naval combat. The water effects are great, and the handling of the ships, as well as the combat are easy to pick up and control wonderfully. My only wish is that there was more of it, or perhaps worked into the main storyline. The homestead building requires you to do side missions that recruit new people into your town. These range from trappers and miners to carpenters and a seamstress. By doing more missions for these people, they gain the ability to produce or fabricate better items which can then be sold to shopkeepers via convoys you send out. Unfortunately, the methods by which to do all this aren’t explained all that well. And neither is the assassin’s guild. Both of these could have used more detailed tutorials and in-game explanations. For a game that is so heavily tutorialised for the beginning portion, is hard to understand why other areas weren’t given the same treatment.If I were to stop right here, I would give this game a glowing summary and a high score. However there are nasty problems that creep up during the course of the game. Regardless of a 17 mb, day-one patch, this may be the buggies game I have ever played. I was constantly receiving in-game notifications unrelated to what was going on. While engaging in a conversation with my mentor, I was shown a prompt to stay out of range of my target so as not to get noticed. Town criers were often spawned in pairs, who were attached at the arm. A side quest I was on refused to accept my puzzle inputs, and after shutting down and restarting, upon completing those puzzles, the animal conflicts afterwards would not accept my button inputs. Finally I resorted to shooting the attacking wolves because nothing was working otherwise. When I was done that quest and given a reward, every subsequent load into a new area would notify me of having picked up that quest reward. This went on for half the game. Wanted posters would often be impossible to take down even though I was standing right against them. This game clearly needed a few more months of polish, and if they had it, I’m sure this would have been the game of the year.The other major knock on this game is the Desmond storyline. While Ubisoft has touted this as the conclusion, by the end of it you can’t help but feel like nobody really had any idea what to do with this. Sure they do come to some sort of ending, but it isn’t satisfying. They had a really great premise in having machines that let you live out the memories of your ancestors, but it went off in weird metaphysical directions. After all this, I still don’t know what Abstergo was doing that made them so bad, or what made the Assassin’s good. The best I can come up with is that they said so. Although I think I can definitely say that if they made an Assassin’s Creed game set entirely in the present time, it probably wouldn’t have been very good.In the end I remain torn. I absolutely think that anyone who has played the previous entries in the series will do well to continue playing. This is adventure worth having. Just be aware that technical issues about, even though they aren’t necessarily game breaking. It’s too bad that the Desmond storyline doesn’t prove to be all that interesting, because it feels like a lot of wasted potential. Nevertheless, Ubisoft has said that there will be more games in the series, so let’s hope that some time away will let them come up will something truly great, and can make good on the promise that this game has shown]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[ I suppose in the interest of full disclosure I should note that at the time I've writing I've yet to finish the game.I'm reckoning I'm over the halfway point at least, but I don't feel it matters none.I'm not scoring the game on it's story. A great game can have a terrible story, a terrible game can have a great story or anything in between and thus far I feel like AC3 is somewhere in between.But again, it matters not. Because it's pretty fun to play.That being said though this is an Assassins Creed game and if you've played previous entries in the series this is going to feel incredibly familiar to you, so you'll be frustrated to find out that the game tutorializes to what you could argue is an absurd extent. The slow burn serves the games narrative well, but it also means it'll be some hours before you're in the game proper.Those of you who for some reason decided to wait until the games fifth iteration before trying at the franchise might well be thankful for the hand-holding, those of us who have been playing from the start will wish there were some option to skip it or at least a toggle so that it'll only cover changes from previous games. But it's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.As familiar as the game feels there are at least a few changes to be mindful of.For instance you no longer hold down A and RT to go into free running mode.Just RT itself will do it and as long as it's possible for you to make it, as long as you're pointing in a direction you'll run, climb and jump all over everything.You can manually jump from ledges the game things would be suicide and as long as you're quick to grab onto something on the way down, you might come out unscathed. More often than not though this will allow you to just jump off a building, take some damage as you hit the ground and move on regardless should you be too impatient to look for a proper way down.All in all the streamlined parkour stuff is makes getting around a lot easier, it's basically point and go which is especially useful now that you'll be climbing and leaping between your fair share of trees.Less changes have been made in the combat department, it's still pretty much entirely dependant on countering a lot - though I won't deny it still makes you feel like a right badass. Guns are more prevalent though, which can make melee combat a bit of a pain should you be engaged in close quarters combat with some, whilst others stand back and pepper you with shots.You can grab your enemy to use as shields but in my experience the success rate has been rather hit and miss. I feel like I'm pressing the right buttons, but often times he just doesn't grab the fellow.Like the last few Assassins Creed games there is an abundance of side missions and collectibles to distract you from the main story, as well as some Naval combat. The ship stuff looks great, though it takes some getting used to. Once you do though it can be great fun and as far as side activities go, this is probably Assassins Creed best yet.Perhaps the best thing about the game is simply the change of setting.As much as I liked Ezio I feel like they should've let him lie at the end of Brotherhood and Revelations was anything but. It was still a fine game, but it was just milking a beloved character just a bit more than they probably should've. Conner isn't as likeable a character as Ezio, though he's interesting in his own way and I'd say he has a better sandbox to play Assassin in.Whether on land or sea the game is visually stunning, especially in the environments though characters aren't too shabby either. Though the game falls short on both regards on the Desmond side of things, as with each passing game he looks increasingly more weasel like. It's quite unfortunate that things are so lopsided.The game sports other technical issues too. On at least a few occasions I've hit scripting errors in which missions had to be restarted for me to progress, as well as some physics quirks in which a horse & cart was barrel rolling its way along the road before shooting into the sky. You expect some hiccups in a game of this variety, but I feel like there's more wrong here that can't just be attributed to ""open world jank"".As unfortunate as these issues are the core Assassins Creed gameplay is still intact, for better or worse.It's as fun to clamor about the game environments, stabbing guys in the face and neck as it ever was so if you've enjoyed previous games then this is more of that - though one might hope that they do more to differentiate themselves from previous games in the next one than merely a change of setting.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[After seeing the first trailer for this game I got excited for it. Finally something else than Italy! But I didn't want to hype myself up too much because I wasn't a big fan of Brotherhood(the previous game that I played in this franchise).The first five seconds of the game is you walking 10 feet and seeing a cut scene then you walk another ten feet and another cutscene also I noticed that I can bearly hear the other character's voices. Their lips don't move(not even during cutscenes). I gave it a pass..ok fine the previous ones had this too nothing to worry about. Then I go to the 1700s and I start playing. Same thing there and also the first 4-6 hours of this game are bunch of tutorials(80% of these missions contain at least four separate spots where you have to press circle to open a door and see a cutscene the walk ten feet press circle again and see a cutscene).The other half of the game that isn't tutorials is enjoyable although the ship battles aren't fun.The framerate jumps from 15-30 very frequently but usually when everything goes perfect it stays at 25-30 fps and in areas where there are nothing but a windmill and a tree it goes to 60 fps which make the game look really nice. The scripting broke for me in two missions and I had to restart from a checkpoint.The fighting seems worse than in the previous games(I didn't play Revelations so maybe they made it worse there). They obviously tried to go for the Batman Arkham Asylum style ""flow fighting"" and they fail at it. Jumping on rooftops isn't as fun as it used to be and sometimes you can't climb to a roof from a certain angle for some reason.The multiplayer is still fun but you have to make a Uplay account so that you can play it.The only person I'd recommend this game to is someone who wants to see how ""the trilogy"" ends. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[As someone who would consider themselves something of an Assassins Creed fan, I looked forward to Assassins Creed 3 more than any other game this year, and while I have enjoyed my time with it, it’s overwhelming similarities to previous entries in the series and the inclusion of some issues that have plagued the series for a number of games now without change has left it feeling underwhelming and a little by the numbers.The biggest change this game is the setting and characters, after a trilogy of games following Ezio through Italy and beyond, revolutionary America is a welcome breath of fresh air. The inclusion of two cities and the frontier, a large mostly open stretch of land connecting New York, Boston and Connors Homestead is a little hit and miss. Both New York and Boston fail to really show any unique characteristics, something that can probably be associated to the very early days of their existence, however they feel incredibly samey and it’s much harder to find yourself learning the map as in previous entries. The frontier and Connors Homestead on the other hand are a really nice change of pace for the series, with some pretty locations, caves to find and explore and animals to hunt and track. The new inclusion of free running through trees can be exciting but is a lot more restrictive than you might imagine, with some very obviously laid out routes to follow and more trees that can’t be climbed at all than those that can.The other major new inclusion is Connor, who has the unwelcome job of having to fill the boots of previous series protagonist Ezio and while Ezio was a likable character, Connor comes off as being very bland. He wants to protect his peoples land and spends a lot of time reminding characters (and the player) that, but with that as his real only driving factor he comes across as being very two dimensional. This is thrown into stark contrast when positioned opposite his father, Haytham Kenway, who in spite of his morally questionable conduct throughout the game comes across as a much more interesting person.The story in Assassins Creed 3 was a major draw for me, the end of the world and Desmond's journey to stop it has always interested me, even if it has felt at times a little silly; however in what is supposedly the concluding chapter of this trilogy of five it almost takes a back seat. The introduction of Connor takes nearly four hours of gameplay to arrive at, while the conclusion of Desmond and friends story at the end of the game is over in no more than 10 minutes, leaving more questions than answers and giving me horrible flash backs to the conclusion of Mass Effect 3.The main quest isn’t all however as Assassins Creed 3 continues the series tradition of being packed full of side quests and extra content, while some of it feels a little hit and miss a lot of it is also very good. The entire arch of missions taking place at the Homestead felt both enjoyable and mature, giving a reason to be invested in these minor NPC’s who are really only there to increase trading abilities in the new Homestead mini game. The naval combat is also a huge surprise and is a great addition that really adds a lot of the most engaging moments in the game, sadly it seems to be limited to single player as a multiplayer mode of naval combat would be very good fun.Visually Assassins Creed 3 runs the gambit from being impressive in some aspects to downright ugly in others. It’s very obvious that Ubisoft Montreal wanted to push the PS3 and Xbox 360 further than it could go, leading to some bad draw distances at times and geometry showing in the distance that would make an N64 blush. It also has some serious issues with frame rate that can cause frustration at the first sign of action, and can drop down to single figures more often than it really should.Overall Assassins Creed 3 is a fun game while it lasts, but anyone expecting something revolutionary or new to the franchise may leave feeling a little sore, as will anyone heavily invested in the story, which falls apart in the last cut scene so badly it can’t help but feel rushed. However if you just want some more Assassins Creed, warts and all it delivers in spades.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I came in to this latest installment in the ever popular Assassin’s Creed series with some pretty high expectations. And for the most part they were all met. I'm a pretty big fan for the older games in the series, so I was pretty hyped to play 3.Assassin’s Creed 3 picks up Desmond's story after the events of Revelations, and there is a nice recap of the story so far at the top of the game, if you missed a game or two like me, but several characters that were introduced in Revelations were new to me. If you haven't played an Assassin’s Creed game before, the basic premise is that you play as Desmond who is strapped to a machine called the animus, which allows him to relive the lives of his ancestors. In this one you don't play as one of Desmond's direct ancestors, but a Native American Assassin named Connor.The story has always been a big part of the Assassin’s Creed series. In 3 they keep the tradition alive with Connor. The game takes place during the American Revolution, and like the Renaissance in 2, the folks at Ubisoft handle the time period exceptionally. Whether you're holding back redcoats for Lafayette or talking to George W. himself, it feels very natural and well done, without re-writing the history books. Most of the characters are very well done, the main Templar you chase is very well acted and realized. I found my self not liking Connor all that much over the course of the game, compared to the previous protagonist, Ezio, Connor felt a little flat and unrelatable. Don't get me wrong, his voice acting is great, and he is modeled amazingly, but his actions don't make the most sense at times, his motivations seem rather two dimensional, and his convictions are shaken at almost a moments notice. It might just be me though, but it is more than made up with all the characters around Connor, all of whom are great.One of the things that always comes to mind for me when I think of an Assassin’s Creed game is the controls. The unique style of holding down a shoulder button to start running has always been a little sloppy in places. In AC3, they make some changes that are generally improvements. For instance holding down R1 makes Connor run, but unlike past games, you don't have to hold X as well, and it is a “safe” run. What that means is if Connor can't make a jump, instead of jumping to his death, he'll stop and allow you to look around and find where you need to jump to. This really helps when you are jumping around in the forests of Colonial America. Because you're no longer in well established, ancient cities in Europe, the buildings you're climbing on are small two to three story dwellings. They still feel nice and fluid to climb, but the smaller, less dense cities lead to me running on the streets a lot more than I wanted too.While never directly billed as such, the name Assassin’s Creed suggests that there is some stealth elements to the game. While there is in this one, and there has been in the past games, in my oppinion it is the weakest part of the game. The controls and the way you move don't lend themselves to stealth very redily, and while the large buildings in the older games allowed you to stealth around verticaly, AC3 really highlights the flaws of trying to stealth around with this kind of control scheme. While it still works okay in the cities, it falls apart as soon as you get out into the wilderness. Trees offer some verticality, but in most instances, they are few and far between. To try and combat this, Connor is able to hide in tall grass. This adds some cover and allows for very minor non-vertical stealth, which doesn't fit the game at all. The lack of a crouch has always been one of my biggest problems with the stealth in the series, and it continues in 3.One of the most exciting new mechanics is the naval combat. Ubisoft demoed this everywhere, and with good reason. I found the naval sections to be some of the most fun in the game. Commanding your ship feels solid and intuitive, and the combat is very easy to get the hang of, making you feel like the master of the seas. There are only a few story missions that involve the ship, but they make sense, and don't feel like they are thrown in wherever.The multiplayer that was introduced in Brotherhood is still present, but I did not give it a try, as I wanted to get this review up as soon as possible. I played a little of the tutorial and it seemed like some minor changes had been made, but it was mechanically still the same.Assassin’s Creed 3 is going to be one of the top selling games of the year, and rightly so. It is one of the best looking games I have played on consoles, and the changes they make to running and the addition of the naval combat make it a great game. The story is well done, the characters are well realized and the side stuff could make the game incredibly long. Despite the infuriating stealth and chase scenes, the game pulls through and delivers an amazing experience. Whether you are fan of the series, or are just looking for a great game that will last you a long time, I recommend Assassin’s Creed 3.If you liked my review, check out my other reviews at: http://atomicexorcism.com]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I have really enjoyed the Assassin's Creed series. The games up through Brotherhood were especially great with each one adding much more to the game and really showing a lot of potential. So I was very excited when I learned that the new installment would take place on the other side of the Atlantic with a fresh new face, new gear, new places and hopefully a lot more variety in everything.In some ways that is what is delivered in Assassin's Creed 3 but the overall feel of the game is that is was rushed to meet the companies deadline and as a result much of the actual game play is very much a rehash of everything that came before. Connor can be an interesting character and they do a great job of having some twists in the story and making that interesting but the gameplay is still spot on identical to the set up of everything in the previous games.It also takes almost half of the game to actually get to play Conner as an assassin. You spend most of that time being introduced to the world in ways that feel unnecessary like playing hide and seek as a young child or hunting feathers. While learning to hunt wild life is good I even felt that took too long to cover and instead of getting into much action you wind up going through repetitive motions.The story is good, but in many ways not nearly as compelling as you would think. Everyone has a childlike quality to them except your enemies which are complete assholes (which is good, makes you want to kill them). It's just that some of the things many of the characters say like ""Shenanigans"" or ""Tom Foolery"" end up breaking any kind of suspension of disbelief you might have with the game which knocks you back into consciousness even if that is something that would have been said during the time period.That isn't to say it is all bad. The naval battles are awesome and easily the best addition to the game. They can be intense, strategic and, most importantly, fun. You can upgrade your ship in a lot of great ways and it is the only part of the game that I have yet to get tired of. It's very addicting.Other than that though I felt this game was a real let down. The minor additions to it and the change of some weapons are nice but just not enough. Not to mention this is probably the glitchiest Assassin's Creed I have ever played. Some scenes don't play out completely, loading screens lead to 2 second clips and back to loading again, people disappear right in front of you for no reason. The only thing that hasn't happened is a complete freeze.Sadly because of all these Cons I can't help but feel that this game would have really been better off if after Assassin's Creed 2 UBISoft had just focused completely on this title instead of Brotherhood and Revelations. I realize they want to make money and this is a top title for them but it would have been so much more breath taking if instead of the baby steps that have lead up to it is was really a giant leap. Plus with all that extra time they could have worked out the kinks and made it a bit more smooth. Considering their deadline of 12/21/2012 they really should have had more people working to make sure this was the best is could be. So sad that Assassin's Creed doesn't deliver nearly as much, it's like Call of Duty now, just a rehash with a fancy new skin.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Leaving the Old World behind and moving the action to 18th-century America,Assassin’s Creed III’s setting is a clear indication of the forward progress the series has decided to take after two years of retreading old ground. The relative side stories of Brotherhood and Revelations were great games in their own right but ACIII is the first full sequel since the series became an annual fixture. It’s big, ambitious and final, concluding the overarching tale of Desmond Miles while telling the story of a completely new character in an unexplored place in time. This momentous scale brings with it its own problems, but perhaps the greatest issue facing ACIII is a sense of burnout after four straight years locked inside the Animus.Desmond is in this game. Trust meIf you’ve been disillusioned with the slow pace of Desmond’s sci-fi meta-story you’ll be pleased to see it come to a head here. After discovering that the world is on the brink of apocalypse, Desmond and his merry Mystery Gang head off in search of a way to stop it, once again entering the Animus and inhabiting the life of one of Desmond’s ancient ancestors.Between all of the 18th-century action, ACIII occasionally cuts back to Desmond, going so far as to send him on a few missions himself, allowing us to finally sample the Assassin move set he picked up from previous protagonist Ezio Auditore. These sections help flesh out an underutilised aspect of the series but the promise Desmond’s present day tale has always carried is never fulfilled. Apart from one early skyscraper sequence his missions are linear and uninspired, and the narrative quickly reaches an abrupt and disappointing conclusion that seems more concerned with dumping a 20-minute credit sequence on your head than allowing for any thoughtful reflection on what just transpired. After five games worth of build up it’s sad to see it crawl to a disheartening whimper.Fortunately the main brunt of the narrative rests on the broad shoulders of Connor Kenway (or Ratohnhaké:ton, if you want to wrap your tongue around that). Half-Native American, half-British, he lacks the charm and instant likeability of Ezio but he’s much more conflicted and sees a greater emphasis placed on his character development. Like ACII, we’re treated to a childhood and adolescence that shapes Connor’s motivations and who he is, gradually building him up before he’s recruited by the Creed.Revenge fuels his quest but there’s also a great sense of idealism and an inherent naivety that comes with that, which is often challenged by men on both sides of the Revolutionary war, pulling Connor and his beliefs in multiple directions. He often feels like a blank slate lacking in personality and you’ll long for the days of Ezio’s charisma and quick wit, but Connor’s interactions with his enigmatic adversaries make for compelling viewing as his loyalties are constantly contested and personal stakes are introduced.Large scale battles are rare but exciting when they appearACIII does a fantastic job of blurring the line between good and evil, right and wrong. This isn’t as blunt as British Loyalists vs. American Revolutionaries, or even Templars vs. Assassins; it’s never so black and white, shrouding both sides in grey. Most of The Founding Fathers weren’t saints, they were slave owners and drunkards who committed heinous acts during The Seven Year War, and ACIII treats them as such. Its villains are set in stone but even their words begin to convince you that what they’re doing is right. It paints them as real human characters with their own established and justified motivations and viewpoints, making them something more than just the historical figures they are – transcending the history books.The backdrop of the Revolutionary War offers many opportunities to explore the era’s most significant moments - and you witness and are involved in many, such as the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of Bunker Hill - but Connor’s story is only tangentially related to the war. He’s not a hero who always saves the day; he fails and falters, but keeps trying. All of the political intrigue is pushed to the background in favour of telling a human tale and developing Connor as a character. It’s an admirable approach that pays off, even if Connor never quite fills out his protagonist’s boots.Where he excels is in the treetops, although you’ll have to wait a long time before you can get there. ACIII’s tutorial lasts a staggering eight hours; an incredibly long introduction that slowly rolls out every new system and mechanic while familiarising you with the way an Assassin’s Creed game plays. It often feels like overload but there’s also a lot of non-tutorialized gameplay within that timeframe, and a large focus on the narrative: establishing characters and the world. Patience is definitely required but if you can muster it then this kind of world building is discernible, and its big twist is especially enjoyable.Once you do eventually don the infamous white robes the world of ACIIIimmediately opens up. There’s always something new to do and something else to distract you on your way to doing it. From hunting wildlife and skinning it to sell, to sitting at a campsite listening to tales of mystical creatures, collecting feathers and opening chests, assassinating targets, crafting materials and sending them on convoys to be sold, scaling the highest structures, saving prisoners from a firing squad, capturing a Templar fortress, playing board games in a pub and searching the eastern seaboard for a long lost treasure, the list surprisingly goes on and on.There’s a breadth of content spread across the cities of Boston and New York and the forested wilderness of the Frontier, constantly pulling you from one direction to the next in search of hidden collectibles and expansive side quests.Weather - particularly snow - plays its partTake your Homestead, for example; a vast piece of land that houses Connor’s home and the game’s economy. Gone are the stream of purchasable shops, replaced by NPCs and their unique set of skills. Optional side quests allow you to recruit people to settle on your Homestead, contributing to the community as lumberjacks, blacksmiths and so on. Gather the right ingredients and they’ll be able to craft items you can’t buy in general stores like specific weapons and larger pouch upgrades, as well as items like clothes and food that generate income.Watching your Homestead continue to grow as more and more people settle is a joy, but the crafting only moves to convolute your acquisition of money, having you shift through counterintuitive menus more often than you care to. The majority of side quests unfortunately feel the same way. Superfluous additions that offer no tangible rewards and little reason to see them through apart from a sense of completion.The search for a long lost treasure provides some of the game’s most impressive platforming moments, but for the most part heading to a waypoint and pressing B is all that’s required to complete a number of quests. They lack the imagination of something like Leonardo Da Vinci’s inventions quest line, or the expansive platforming beneath the city of Rome, disappointing with their linearity and repetition.And yet it’s incredibly easy to find yourself immersed in this world, searching every nook and cranny for one last almanac page, no matter how incidental the reward. This is due in no small part to improvements made to the series’ base gameplay mechanics and its rendition of 18th-century America. The cities of Boston and New York are meticulously designed, from the crumbling and ash-covered remnants of New York’s great fire through to a bustling market street watched keenly by an ominous group of Red Coats, and a harbour housing gargantuan ships and small fishing boats. It feels authentic and alive, all the while offering a verticality that allows you to seamlessly bound to its highest peak in a matter of moments.The fluidity of treetop platforming is fantasticPlatforming has been refined, smartly preventing you from unintentionally leaping to your death by freeing the jump button for use only when you want to use it. You can climb and leap without fear, gleaning joy from its fluidity and ease of use. And this is only expanded once you enter the Frontier and its natural beauty. As a Native, Connor learned at an early age how to effortlessly move through the treetops. Before long you’ll instantly recognise its climbing points, able to distinguish a route through the trees and glide along it in an instant. The treetops may offer an intricately designed path but it feels completely natural, complimented by excellent animation and visuals that capture the superb art design.Though with this added scale and visual fidelity comes a host of technical issues. The frame rate is inconsistent and often stuttering, especially in cities. The draw distance is also rather poor, coating the landscape in a layer of distant fog, and pop-in appears constantly. Although neither of these technical problems compares to the amount of bugs and glitches likely to appear in your playthrough.From visual oddities like NPCs regularly filtering in and out of existence to more substantial concerns like the scripting continuously failing, forcing restarts. You’ll help a group of Patriots and have them thank you before they suddenly attack for no reason. You can swing your sword all you want but your hits won’t register, forcing you to run away or randomly vibrate on the spot as the game struggles to deal with what’s transpiring.Then you’ll encounter assassination targets that can’t be attacked, or a town crier that can’t be bribed when your notoriety is high. Maybe you’ll head to a map marker for a mission only to find nothing there. Sometimes that same map marker will completely disappear, or you’ll be unable to hire assassin recruits for the entire game. It’s a disappointing and frustrating laundry list of glitches that places a dampener on proceedings. For one of the biggest releases of the year, it’s inexcusable.And other issues persist within the gameplay and mission design. Combat remains as simplistic as ever. A few quick sword strikes and a counter attack is enough to defeat most enemies; other, tougher enemies require an extra button press to break their guard before attacking, but the variety presented by smoke bombs and firearms is an option of choice rather than a requisite. Nonetheless, combat remains enjoyable despite its lack of challenge, the free-flowing nature, brutality of each hit and variation of animations dependent on each weapon is wholly satisfying. It’s when attempting to be stealthy that ACIII falters.Firearms play a role but are incredibly slowBrush and long grass present opportunities for Connor to hide, while haystacks and verticality give him an extra helping hand. But immediate fail states leave little room to be anything but immaculate; a difficult proposition considering the lack of effective stealth mechanics. Not only can your enemies see for miles but there is no sort of crouch or stealth ‘mode’, leaving you to stand in broad daylight, quite unlike any trained assassin. It feels clumsy and you’re never quite sure how it works. Sometimes if you try to hide in a pile of bushes after being seen Connor will just stand up, while other times he will actually hide. It’s inconsistent and inconsistency is the bane of any stealth game; the linearity of these sections and immediate fail states halts emergent improvisation.And then you come to the chase sequences and the accomplishments of the platforming are foregone and replaced by frustration. The myriad of contextual actions leaves you blending into crowds when you don’t want to, accidentally climbing up buildings or hugging the corner of a wall. Guards will knock you down and won’t let you back up, and then you find the mission design has you running laps unless you manage to find a specific shortcut to close the gap. You and your target running along the same route, past the same people and the same guards; the Benny Hill theme running in your head as it’s the only thing that makes sense.But now you find yourself on the open sea and all those grievances seem inconsequential. You’re captaining a mighty vessel, sails bustling in the wind and cannonballs roaring through the sky, culminating in a glorious explosion and amplified by a riveting score. A thunderous storm approaches, creating monstrous waves that threaten to capsize these ancient ships. You line up your shots between the waves, letting loose when the opportunity arises. You change course, travelling with the momentum of the wind beneath your sails, powering full speed ahead to ram your target, crippling their hull and leaving them defenceless.Naval combat is a fantastic addition to the series. There’s unbounded satisfaction to be had destroying other ships and gliding across the water; the mechanics work exceptionally well. Each turn of the wheel has real weight behind it, the close proximity of the camera inciting immersion while the weather and water effects consistently amaze.Assassins assassinating assassinsThe series’ unique brand of multiplayer also makes a triumphant return. Contextualised as an Abstergo project to be sold as the next big gaming system, there’s an admirable attention to narrative that results in enjoyably hokey live-action advertisements unlocking as you level up. Its tense assassin vs. assassin gameplay is as accomplished as ever as you attempt to hunt down a specific target (or targets) without being killed yourself. There’s immense satisfaction to be gleaned from outwitting your foes, blending into a crowd and stunning your hunter at the last possible moment, or leaping from a rooftop to achieve a high scoring kill on the unsuspecting target below.Refinements have also been made to the way it presents information to you. Much like Mark of the Ninja’s approach to stealth and the way information is visually displayed within the environment, ACIII’s multiplayer uses audio cues. If you have line-of-sight on your target a heartbeat can be heard, increasing in volume as you move closer. If your hunter has a bead on you you’ll be able to hear whispers, letting you know to be extra cautious and prepare to get that all-important stun attack if you can master its strict timing.There’s also a new co-op mode called Wolf Pack, where four players can team up against AI targets with a countdown clock limiting your progression to the next target. You’ll want to move fast to limit the countdown, while also working together to earn bonuses like multi-kill that require you and your team-mates to perform near-simultaneous assassinations. It’s completely engaging, though, like most co-op modes, it works best with people you know.When its glitches reveal themselves and poor design designs and mechanics arise, it’s easy to be disappointed with Assassin’s Creed III. But the risks it takes with its storytelling, the focus on characterisation and the way it expands and refines its gameplay fundamentals and how it approaches an open-world, strikes a unique balance between chagrin and gratifying elements that almost make you forget its indiscretions. That it fails to address issues that have plagued the series since its inception is regrettable, but it would be foolhardy to expect another leap as substantial as the one taken between the original Assassin’s Creed and its first sequel. Nonetheless, despite staving off series burnout, Assassin’s Creed III still doesn’t quite do enough. What it does do well it does with confidence, but uncharacteristic issues prevent it from being top of the class.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 3 is a stealth and combat focused RPG which switches between modern times and the american revolution. You primarily switch between Desmond Miles, from the previous games, and Connor, a native american. The story starts out slow but eventually picks up slightly.The graphics are improved slightly from the previous iteration, but it is really nothing to write home about. Those improvements are marred by performance issues in the form of a horrible frame-rate during high-action scenes, mostly during chases in the major cities. I also found that characters would fail to open their mouth during cut-scenes which ruined the immersion.There is nothing to report as far as audio goes, effects are adequate and the voice-acting is passable as well.Overall game-play is disappointing due to an over-simplification in almost every pre-existing game-play element. Combat boils down to just remembering to hold the counter button. It is made too easy by the AI who will just wait for you to finish killing their friends to attack you. There are some new weapons as well but they just fall into the same niche as old or existing weapons. Rooftop hiding spots have been removed while guards will still attack you. It makes rooftop chases near impossible to get out of without killing the pursuers. This combined with the inability to grab ledges while falling makes rooftop action too much of a risk, and ruins the thrill. The apprentice assassin system has been simplified as well, making it slightly less appealing. Purchasing of property has been removed entirely and Connor's ""home city"" has been given a crafting a materials system. As well, instead of buying and investing in shops, you complete missions to add people to your city to perform various functions. One of the two major addition to the game-play is the naval battles and the associated upgrades which are fun, but become boring and repetitive very quickly. The other major addition is hunting which occurs in the open wooded areas outside of major cities, I found it to be boring and mostly uninspired because it encourages dumb luck and a lot of time just waiting for animals to kill.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[(Please Note: This is a review for the single player portion of the game.)I've  been a fan of the                                 Assassin's Creed franchise for a while; always  looking forward to each release. Although the fatigue was indeed setting  in after the previous title                                Assassin's Creed: Revelations, I still had  optimism for this next numbered title. While my experience with the game  was good, there were some select issues with the game that need to be  addressed and ironed out should they (read: inevitably do) release their  next title.To Put It Bluntly:  Assassin's Creed 3 delivers on  its engaging world and characters in the                              animus, but falls short in its  science fiction delivery of its modern day overarching plot.The  game takes its time introducing (and for long-time fans: reintroducing)  basic mechanics, but while this trails behind, the new interesting  setting for the game is opening around you: the                             Boston-                           New York area  during the mid to late 18th century (1700s) at the time of the                           American Revolution. Being in this area at this time means that cities aren't as  sprawling or tall like in                          Israel and                         Italy, so you will be spending more  of your time on the ground rather than on rooftops. But while the  cities may not be as grand as before, the game makes up for this with a  vast and beautiful forest frontier.Once you get past the  beginner tutorials and plot hooks, you finally take control of                        Connor: a  half-and-half Native-British man with a duty to protect his village  from the advancement of the colonies. Having grown up in a different  environment than                       Altair or                      Ezio, Connor has the know-how of traversing  the treetops of the large frontier. This is handled better then I would  have expected from the somewhat clumsy controls of the franchise.  Although this game still has the occasional issue of climbing when you  don't intend to.Personal Positives: There is nothing short to  do in this title. You can hold off from main missions and accomplish a  variety of side tasks or collectables indicated on your map. Even when  finished with the story, there are ways to unlock character and  environment cheats to play with.Amongst Connor's skills is a  knack for hunting. Using a range of tools and tricks he can investigate  the landscape to identify animal types, bait or trap the area, hide in  bushes or trees, and range hunt with arrows or get up close and personal  to get a clean and high quality kill. This is a fun means to pass the  time aided by the multiple ways to stalk and kill prey. Though its  engaging, the reasons to hunt are mostly unmotivated.You can  sell your bounty to shops for quick money, or you can save your  resources and invest them back into your homestead. Similar to                      Monteriggioni in                    Assassin's Creed 2, Connor can help his Assassin mentor  Achillies build up his land by recruiting people through brief missions  and using their services in building and trading. With enough work, you  can use the homestead to upgrade yourself with better ammo and weapon  capacity. This system while ambitious, is poorly introduced and  explained. Even though the character upgrades could be helpful, they are  mostly unessential. I've carried the same equipment (like axe and  pistol) through the entire game and did not feel the need to change  them.Another poorly introduced feature is a once cherished one:  the assassin recruits. Each recruit is character whom you influence to  the assassin side by doing liberation side missions in the two cities.  Most of these show up on your map, but you must notice a few of the key  ones when you pass by an area, which can be annoying. Once full  recruits, each new member adds a new recruit skill like having a  marksman take out an enemy, or enemy disguised recruits to help escort  you into a restricted zone. So while the recruits can come in handy,  completing their goals can take a significant chunk of your time.Personal Negatives: I  have been very interested in                   Desmond's story over all              the             Assassin's            Creed           games, but I wasn't so thrilled with the conclusion to his  efforts. The explanation for Desmond's actions are there, but as a  player I felt little choice in the matter and over all it seemed rushed.Though  the wide collection of features seem to have no real correlation, the  events of Connor in the American Revolution make for the familiar  compelling storytelling that comes with the Assassin's Creed titles.  It’s especially fascinating to anyone who has studied American history  in school. You will recognize              historic names, dates, and events as they  transpire, and it is always interesting to see how Connor gets into  these situations.Connor is an outsider finding himself in the             Assassin Order through visions of fate. He has a very personal stake to  help his people and kill the ones who oppose him. You see a fair bit of  grey area towards the Templars, and it helps show that neither side has a  large amount of influence on the new            American soil. I found myself  confused as to Connor's motivations towards helping other characters,  but in a way it makes sense since Connor is just as confused about the  situation and who to help as I was.Thoughts on Improving: Its  time to breathe more life into the modern setting sections. Missions  were a good start, but for being an Assassin, there hasn't been any real  modern day assassinations. Also, if the manual for your game has to  come on the disc, put more information in it. Explain your systems and  menus better, and show the benefits of using them.Outside  Connor's story, the science-fiction hook is in full effect, with Desmond  doing real world missions for artifacts that power the plot device to  save the world from death and destruction. Though these sections are  limited and linear, they slightly scratch the itch of a set in modern  day Assassins Creed and left me wanting more. The          human         characters on  the outside still leave something to be desired, but the addition of            Desmond's father helps a bit. The holographic ""       ones who came before"" are  showing more signs of mortality, which don't mesh well with their  portrayal as near-gods in the previous titles.With Desmond's  efforts having come to a close, I personally felt the ending lacked  player involvement. The solutions for the impending       doomsday were  explained, but once Desmond makes his own choice it all ends rather  abruptly. Though there is a way for Assassin's Creed to continue on, the  finality of the ending will hopefully bring something refreshing to the  modern day side, just like each numbered game has brought a something  completely new to the animus side.   ----------------Appending  Thoughts: Before I forget completely, I should also say that I never really experienced too many technical  issues or glitches like some of other reviews. I did have the occasional  floating gun or frozen guard, but nothing that really hindered my  progress. Also, I was frustrated with the 100% sync options, but I had  the same feelings toward that feature in past games too, and it really  isn't anything that holds the game back. It's just a mental  completionist thing.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[The Assassin's Creed series has always been a point of discussion. The highly detailed historical settings have kept fans craving each installation, while technical problems and strange game play decisions have always kept the series from perfection. Assassin's Creed 3 is more of the same, and while many of the ideas at play are creative, it's the implementation of these ideas that falls flat.From its opening moments playing as a new character in franchise fiction, one thing is made very clear, the visuals at play in AC3 are nothing if not stunning. The atmosphere of a crowded British play house is conveyed so well that I found myself stopping to admire the actors on stage ignoring the fast paced tension of the mission at hand. Characters in the theater lobby and throughout the rest of the game interact within and inhabit the world in a way that gives cities a ""lived in"" atmosphere. Dogs bark, chickens peck at food on the ground, and citizens go about their business with a natural look and feel. The crews of trade vessels sing folk tunes and red coat soldiers patrol the streets to the resounding pace of a drummers timing. The technical and graphical improvements don't stop with the AI though. Winter snow makes travelling by foot more difficult as the player character is forced to trudge knee deep through white powder. While making your way through the treetops of the colonial frontier gives a true sensation skill and precision exhibited by AC3's main character Connor Kenway.As the main character, most of the player's time is spent playing as Connor, the native American assassin who replaces Ezio's cool wit with a quiet and angry attitude. Connor is a young man more obsessed with vengeance than the lofty ideals of the Assassins. Until situations force him from his home and into the service of an ex member of the Brotherhood named Achilles. His time spent with the old man forges an angry young boy into a killing machine, and before you know it Connor's quest for revenge is off and running.The story has always been a point of contention with me regarding the Assassin's Creed series. The sometimes awkward balance between the stories of Desmond and his ancestors has in past games become somewhat of an issue for me when balanced against the worlds the AC games create for the player to live in. AC3 suffers from the same problems, constantly wedging historical personalities in at ""just the right moment"" for effect breaks the immersion I as the player have with the game world. Similar to my issues with DaVinci in AC2, characters like Benjamin Franklin show up to introduce mechanics and really have no weight on the overall story. Missions with these characters tended to be my least favorite parts of the game.The Boston Tea Party scene loses its power when I'm struck with the realization that it's just me and a few other characters tossing boxes of tea off a ship with the occasional fight thrown in while the crowd cycles the same three cheering motions over and over again. The midnight ride of Paul Revere is almost laughably bad, with Connor piloting Revere's horse while he sits on the back pointing in the right direction to ride. The story seems to get weaker and weaker as the game goes along, and the mechanics at play cripple it. A chase scene with an assassination target went on for ten minutes as we ran in a circle, with me never realizing I simply needed to take a shortcut at the beginning of the chase to cut them off. While another mission had me running from cover to cover to avoid oncoming fire from the other side of the battle, a moment that seemed promising, but the on screen indication for when I could move and when to take cover was never explained and I found myself trapped in a never ending loop of running to three cover points and dying at the fourth. All of these situations become manageable after a few tries, but by the time I had figured out what I was doing wrong I was just frustrated at the games lack of explanation.The real issue that broke me out of the game's immersion though are the mountains of game breaking bugs I encountered. A fellow on this sites forums summed it up best when he said, ""Loading the game up to play is like playing Russian roulette."" Some sessions I would have nothing but problems. Chugging frame rate that never seemed to settle, mission characters that would wonder out of the mission zone forcing me to restart, people falling through the environment or simply disappearing; the list goes on and on. These of course are all things that could be fixed through patches, but as of the last time I loaded the game up they persisted. Then, sometimes I would load the game up and have no problems what so ever.With the complaints out of the way, I can get into what makes this game worth playing. While the story and the attached missions are all lacking in their own ways, it's the world that AC3 creates that makes this an experience worth having. The hunting is fun, simple yet complex, and a valuable source of income for Connor. Building up the homestead offers stories more interesting and diverse than anything in the main story. Naval combat is a gorgeous distraction that almost warrants a game all on its own. AC3 seems like a case of too many grand ideas, and not enough execution, as most of these missions are just happened upon by the player or just lightly touched upon within the main story. I felt like finishing the main story of AC3 is what opened the game world up and really made it something special. Freeing forts and battling at sea was a refreshing retreat after the rigid structure of the main story quests.All technical issues aside the game's amazing world and interesting ideas offer up enough content to warrant a sixty dollar purchase. The game package really comes together when you add in the fantastically creative AC multiplayer experience. Pretending to be an AI character while hunting your prey (other players) is rewarding and builds real tension. The addition of sound cues to the game play pulls the experience together, ridding the multiplayer of the ""cheap"" kills in previous installments. Full character customization funded by in game earned currency gives each of the characters a personal touch and seeing them at the end of each round standing together or performing a little cut scene feels rewarding. It's a multiplayer mode worth checking out in a market over saturated by the type of run and gun fast paced game play in first person shooters.TL/DR:Assassin's Creed 3 is a game full of awesome ideas plagued by bugs/glitches and overly structured game play. A game that most players will enjoy more after the shackles of the games narrative no longer confine them and they are free to roam what is one of this generations best open worlds.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[The Assassins Creed franchise has been of a consistently high quality, even at its lower points, it functioned well for what it set out to do. Assassins Creed 3 does none of that. The game is mediocre in almost every area; the story, gameplay, graphics, frame-rate, characters, controls, camera, name any part of an Assassins Creed game, nay, a game, and you'll find it better in any of the other entries.The story:The story in Assassins Creed 3 seems like a side-note in a larger story. Without spoiling anything, the ending leaves the player with no sense of closure, and belittles most of the entire game.The lucky ancestor Miles is conveniently descended from this time is ""Connor Kenway"" He has a traditional Native American name, but I'm not even going to attempt to spell it. But yes, he is a native American man out to get revenge against the men who burned down his village. The main problem is that he's not a particularly interesting protagonist, his arc isn't very meaningful, and his personality (What little is there) doesn't really change throughout the game. He also sounds almost identical to Hayden Christiansen, which gets to be really distracting, but also fitting, given how Connor is kind of whiney for the duration of the game.So after Darth Jumper's village is burned down, he sets out to find the men responsible in a Kill Bill-esque setup. Then he finds an elderly black man (I only bring up that he's black because the game is set in the 1770s, and he is a rich black man who just happens to be an assassin. Now, I'm no history buff, but I'm pretty sure African Americans weren't exactly on great terms with the people of the whiter persuasion back in those days. If he was just some mountain man living in secrecy then it might make more historical sense, but he's rich, lives in a mansion, and goes into town on a carriage at one point, getting no odd looks in the process. At one point they acknowledge that whole Slavery thing, but only in passing, and it has no impact on anything whatsoever.) So then Rich old man trains young Connor to become a master assassin, I don't want to say he molested our young hero, but he is never shown to have, or have had, a wife, or any interest in women. So take that as you will. Then after this is when the game actually starts, about four hours in you get to start running around and working towards the actual goal of the game. Yep, that's how slow this game starts. You spend several hours not even playing as Connor, in what turn out to be some of the better moments of the game. None of that would be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the base story is only about 11 hours long. Which is only an adequate length by the standards of today, but personally, spending $60 for an 11 hour game with some mediocre multiplayer, and boring side content seems like a bum deal to me.So once the story gets going, you find Connor meeting people from throughout American history, taking part in historical battles and events, and just being randomly thrown into places he doesn't belong. Maybe this only noticeable because of how much more recent and well documented these events are compared to the events in AC2 and the like, but Connor just seems really out of place here. They put less of an effort into putting him into the background, as if the assassins were secretly helping out, and more to front of things. By the end of this game Connor should have statues of him everywhere, he would have been an American hero. Which just seems to go against the basic idea of this series. Also, this is a little nitpicky, but the white robes are pretty out of place here. In the 1st game you were surrounded monks who were all dressed similarly. In 2, everyone was wearing garish outfits, so it fit. But in 3, everyone is wearing military uniforms from that era, there is absolutely nobody for Connor to blend in with. There's no reason why anyone would see this white robed Native American standing next to a bunch of Red Coats and think they're remotely connected. The white robes feel forced, like they're only still part of these games because that's what people associate with Assassins Creed, instead of what's best for the series.The Gameplay:The way Assassins Creed 3 plays is almost identical to the other games, except not nearly as fun or functioning. The combat is almost too easy to the point where you see a group of about twenty Redcoats and feel no sense of being overwhelmed. The only times I found the combat to be difficult was when the game was actively working against me playing it. Be it Connor getting knocked down and then just not standing up, enemies glitching in and out of walls, and enemies hitting me when I was nowhere near them. The combat overall feels needlessly easy, and turns into nothing but a chore to have to wait through. It's essentially just you hitting two buttons while not moving towards your goal for about 15 seconds every few minutes. I opted to avoid combat as much as possible, since it wasn't worth the time.But what I think might be the worst part of the way the game plays is the traversal. The way you get around the city is (Like the rest of the game) almost identical to the older games, only different in that it's way worse. Connor would seemingly at random just jump at walls, run up nothing, walk in the opposite direction that I was aiming him, and just overall moving like he's trying to walk the dinosaur, but doesn't know how. The only times I found the climbing to be anything but frustrating was when the game did it for me. Just holding the stick in a single direction will occasionally make Connor move seamlessly through the environment. Which only adds to my frustration because the game doesn't let me have any actual control over the cool movements.Another part of the movement that is absolutely horrible is the larger areas. Now, these areas are actually the best parts of the game in terms of style and function, but they're far too large, and the only real reason you'd spend any time in there would be to run through them to get to an area that you can't fast travel to, which only happens a couple of times, but still takes way too long and reminds me of games like Oblivion or Skyrim, except you don't encounter caves or anything remotely interesting in the large world. They try to do you a solid by placing horses near you whenever you need to go over a large area. But!...No, no no no, those goddamn horses deserve their own section.THE HORSES:The horses are the worst thing about this already irritating game. Not only do they move at a snails pace, they can't really go off the main road, the road which doesn't necessarily take you to your destination. So if you try to ride a horse, you're going to need to go off road at some point. Which, the game lets you take them off the road, but they really shouldn't. The horses can't go over most rocks. Even small or flat rocks, horses are apparently the mortal enemies of rocks. They refuse to even associate with each other. Except on the random occasion where they do choose to work together, where the game breaks, and the horse can't move off of the rock, then ends up glitching out and being useless, forcing you to abandon the horse. The rocks are the worst of it, but trees are also pretty bad; they're worse than the rocks in a few ways, like how the rocks will randomly let you over them and destroy the minuscule usefulness of your horse, the trees will randomly not let you pass, and randomly disappear. The trees and rocks that don't let you through are somehow worse than the gamebreaking rocks, because these ones turn your horse with no indication as to why you can't pass them. And hey, you wanna hear something funny? They put rocks and trees fucking EVERYWHERE! Even on the main path! it's as though they designed these huge sprawling environments, then realized it takes way too long to traverse them, so their solution was to throw untested horses in there. I refuse to believe anyone play-tested these horses and thought ""This meets the level of quality associated with the Assassins Creed name"" Unbelievably horrible.Back on Gameplay:The other gameplay segment that needs to be complained about is when they make you take part in ship battles. These segments aren't good. That's all there is to it, they're not fun to play, they take too long, and (Like the rest of the game) are very poorly checkpointed, also, they just don't control very well. There's nothing horribly offensive about them, they're just tedious and boring. They don't have any sense of urgency or feeling of being a cool ship captain. The aiming on the cannons is poor, and the handling on the ships is sub-par. Luckily there are only three of these segments during the main story, and they only last a few minutes each, but they just don't belong in the game. They feel like they were from some other game and thrown in to fill some time and reuse some assets.Now, you know those mission types from the other Assassins Creed games? Like, tailing, chasing, and going unnoticed while working your way through an area? Well those are all back, only made frustrating by the glitch-ridden controls, and the piss-poor checkpointing.The tailing missions are made frustrating by Connor jumping around like he ate the Spring-Spring fruit without my consent, which either lost the guy I was tailing, or threw me right next to him. Every time I had to play one of these missions was incredibly frustrating.The chases were made frustrating solely by the controls being as sloppy as they are, Connor not responding to my commands, and enemies hitting you when you're nowhere near them make these missions unnecessarily tedious. The worst of this is a chase near the end of the game, I'm not going to spoil it, but the game is very specific in how far you can get from him, and if you make a single mistake then you're too far from him. All of this is made worse when Connor gets hit from four feet away, then lies on the ground until the mission fails.But by far the worst of these mission-types are the sneaking missions. They're only slightly different from the tailing in that while tailing you can only not be noticed by one person, in the stealth missions you have to not get noticed by anyone. And according to Assassins Creed 3, the person getting stealth killed counts as someone seeing you. I was on a ship, had stealth killed everyone but one person, I check the mini-map, looked around, then stealth killed a guy...Desynchronized. Ridiculous.But you know the main issue with all of these? If you mess up at any point, you have to start from the beginning of the mission. The checkpoints are almost non-existent. I found myself cursing at my screen under my breath every time the game messed up and forced me to play another segment again. I was only so upset by it because it wasn't that I messed up, I could deal with the game being difficult, but difficult isn't a word that should ever be associated with this game, if you fail then it's more than likely because the game glitched and cheated you.The game also suffers from what I call ""Uncharteds Disease"" and that means that it has set-pieces shoe-horned in. Which, I'm fine with, I like set-pieces when they're done well, I think they can be cool. But Assassins Creed 3 doesn't do them well. They make it far too easy to fail, forcing you to start it over from the beginning. It robs you of any cinematic tone it might otherwise instill. The moment you have to play a cool part over again it's immediately an annoyance. It just devolves into memorizing what you're supposed to do instead of being overwhelmed by the set-piece. People often say they would like set-pieces to take less control away from the player, but if this is what they meant, then please no.But, just because there are several really poorly done set-pieces, a few of them (When they work) are actually pretty awesome.But those cool moments are few and far between, so you just end up playing frustrating set-pieces that barely work, and are underwhelming when compared to the standards set by pretty much any other game that uses set-pieces. I would say that I'm happy there are no QTEs, but whenever you're in the forests running to the next location, the animals who attack you will force you to take part in pointless button prompts, which don't kill you if you fail, but will take almost all of your life. You're also only given a very small period of time to press them.The Graphics:First off, while it isn't directly related to the graphics, it is related to the way the game looks. What I'm talking about is the frame-rate: It's awful, the textures aren't so great, and there aren't bustling crowds to warrant it. The frame-rate remains consistently low throughout the game, but is made way worse whenever you trigger the guards to chase you.Now, the textures are okay, they have some good leather tech here, but faces looks awful, towns look bland and washed-out, and character animations are extremely stale and cheap looking.Hey! You wanna know a fun fact about Olde Time America? It looks largely identical to ancient Italy! Who knew?! Seriously though, the two cities you're in are a mess of reused assets and recycled character models. It often looks like you're playing AC2, but dim with bad controls.Overall, this game looks dated, it's on five year-old hardware, and it shows. But I know, graphics don't make the game, if the game is fun then the graphics don't matter. But this game isn't fun!Final Summary:When looking at Assassins Creed 3, I just feel disappointed. I see what could have been. The story could have been something special, but fell to several poor decisions. The gameplay is there, it just doesn't work very well. The frame-rate makes the other parts worse. But this game had so much potential, it makes me sad that I don't like it. It's such a great concept, a revolutionary war action adventure game! Who would have thought that we'd get that? I love that we did, I just wish the game worked more consistentlyz.But you know what, even if the game did function well, it would still be a boring experience overall. There's nothing special here. It's short, boring and the side-content is pointless/boring. Don't buy Assassins Creed 3. Just go get it from Redbox or something.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Originally posted on www.knowngriefers.comUtterly. Batshit. Insane. There is really no other way to convey the wild storytelling of Assassin’s Creed III. After spending the past three games with Ezio Auditore, ACIII finally introduces new protagonists, not the mention an entire New World. The time-bending meta-story of Desmond Miles is also heavily featured, eventually wrapping itself around into the present day. Multiple location shifts span decades, making Assassin’s Creed III feel like the most expansive entry yet.Ubisoft’s action/stealth/ RPG/ stabbing simulator franchise has become one of the best of this generation. From the original’s release in 2007, the series has expanded in amazingly new and fresh ways with each new iteration. Well, make the almost every iteration. Last year’s Assassin’s Creed Revelations was a good game, though seen by some as the series spinning its wheels. Major changes have come to the franchise in Assassin’s Creed III, however, and this game’s incredible scope and dense storytelling are both its greatest asset and biggest downfall.The AC series has leaned further and further into its sci-fi meta-story with each new entry. The present day character of Desmond Miles has spent plenty of time reliving the experiences of his Assassin ancestors at this point, and has experienced quite a few bleeding effects from his time in the Animus. The Templars, under the guise of the Abstergo corporation, are hot on his heels, and Desmond’s makeshift team of allies must rush to find the secrets of the past in order to prevent Templar control of the present. In addition, the Mayan “end of the world” 12/21/12 date plays a major role in the series, as if there wasn’t enough going on. How the Templars, Assassins, and the apocalypse all fit together can sometimes be a confusing mess of conspiracy theories, double agent characters, and convoluted alien prophecies.A New World.Assassin’s Creed III brings the in-Animus action jumping forward from Ezio’s adventures in the Renaissance, to the founding of America and the early days of the 13 colonies. As such, the landscape and setting of ACIII is quite different than past games, with large amounts of wilderness surrounding the dense streets of Boston and its outlying settlements. The early hours of the game are startlingly unique to the series, with a long trip across the Atlantic aboard a ship with a mutinous crew. Following some intense plot twists, the real meat of the game doesn’t even open up until several hours into the story. If you thought Ezio’s story in Assassin’s Creed II took some time to get going, you’re going to be in for an even longer set-up in ACIII.The setting of ACIII takes place primarily in the early days of New England, and the region is beautifully realized. Wide-open vistas are full of tall pine tress, and are densely populated with wildlife ripe for the hunting. While exploring the Frontier does not quite reaching the level of necessity or quality seen in Red Dead Redemption, it is a welcome addition to the series. Stalking wildlife through tall grass or setting snares for hapless rabbits is far more enjoyable than some of the past side activities in the series, although the only real reward for doing so is selling the collected pelts to vendors in town.The major cities in ACIII are wonderfully realized, with clapboard and brick houses lining the busy streets. Anyone who has been to Boston can attest to the fact that the city was seemingly laid out by M.C. Escher, and those twisting streets are accurately portrayed here. The sudden twists-and-turns provide copious ways to escape pursuing enemies, and new mechanics such as bursting through open doors make the player to feel even more nimble than before.Hot man-on-man action in the forest.It is unfortunate then, that the game engine sometimes seems to struggle under its own weight. When the action spills out into streets filled with people, soldiers, animals, and environmental effects, the framerate can sometimes take a staggering hit. At some points early in the game, the action seemed to slow to sub-10 FPS. In addition to framerate woes, there is a surprising amount of pop-in. It can occasionally feel almost like playing games from previous generations, particularly when enemy soldiers magically appear 50 feet in front of the player. At this point, it’s clear that a new generation of hardware is incredibly necessary in order to allow series with a scope as far-reaching as Assassin’s Creed to thrive.When everything is working in the game’s favor, the action is as great as players have come to expect from the Assassin’s Creed series. The main protagonist, Connor, is equipped with all the requisite assassin skills, and packs a few new surprises as well. In addition to the previously mentioned hunting tricks, Connor’s weapons draw from his Native American heritage. The tomahawk replaces most of the hidden blade’s functionality from previous games, and new weapons such as the rope dart provide new ways to stab guys in the face.The ally system introduced in Brotherhood is here as well, although it is introduced rather sloppily. First time comers to series could easily overlook the entire mechanic and never be the wiser. At this point in the series, there is much that is expected of the player, that it sometimes seems as though the game would be near impenetrable to newbies. While it is understandable that Ubisoft wouldn’t expect people to jump in with the concluding entry, it wouldn’t hurt to give returning players a refresher course every now and then.Tool tips, system messages, and Animus updates constantly pop-up in the corner and it is easy to overlook them all in the heat of action. Several other systems seem to be downright missing from ACIII, as regenerating health replaces the need for doctors of the previous games. There is also no discernable way to change the hue of Connor’s clothes, something that was a fun way to customize previous games. While seemingly in service of streamlining the player’s experience, it is sad to see some of the more RPG-like elements stripped from the series.Historical figures once again play a major part in the storyline, each with humorous and education Animus entries to accompany them. Throughout your journey, players will interact with Ben Franklin, Paul Revere, Sam Adams, and several other people you might recognize from history class. Major points in the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars serve as set pieces here, so don’t be surprised when Paul Revere asks you to accompany him on his famous Midnight Ride.Major landmarks are lovingly recreated, and those familiar with New England will feel a particular amount of pride and familiarity with the landscape. Previous settings such as the Middle East and Rome were enjoyable, although only recognizable as historical places, far removed from the present day. With Assassin’s Creed III being set in America, it provides new context for historical events that took place right in our own backyard. Watching an Assassin scale a building you’ve actually been to is a surreal experience.These guys are still looking for something. I guess.The game has an incredible sense of propulsion, driving players through the lengthy campaign. There is a wealth of content in Assassin’s Creed III, though the twisting and turning plotline is told well enough to drive most players straight to the next story beat. All told, when you get right down to it, Assassin’s Creed III still plays like Assassin’s Creed. But it is the quality of the storytelling and the accompanying cinematics that pull the series along. Both stories, that of Connor’s adventures in the late 18 century and Desmond’s quest for the secrets of the Precusors, are the true draw here, and it is a thrilling adventure to see them through to their bombastic conclusions.FINAL VERDICT: 4/5This review is based on the Xbox 360 single-player campaign. The technical problems described herein may differ on other systems. Multiplayer is also included, although not played for review.Christopher Linendoll is hiding in the shadows.

Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series began its life with a flawed but promising progenitor; a game with ideas but not enough confidence to venture beyond the small group of repeating missions that led to each of the game's set-piece assassinations. Assassin's Creed II managed to do what all video game sequels aspire to; not only be bigger and better, but use what its developers had learned from the mistakes of their earlier project to perfect the formula. That the same formula has been used for every subsequent game speaks volumes.However, after three iterations of using this same template on which to build the game's typical mix of tactical murdering and hokey sci-fi conspiracy thriller narration, it has become very creaky indeed. It doesn't help that the annualization of these games has left little time for the developers to correct the flies in the ointment; instead focusing on building new features on top of it and hoping the resulting rickety structure doesn't fall apart.If I'm being overly critical about the otherwise satisfactory Assassin's Creed III, it's because - even more so than with the coolly-received Revelations - the format is starting to show its age. I can't help but think that the many interesting ideas this game has to offer are poorly served by its adherence to this old engine and its growing list of liabilities and limitations.Assassin's Creed III follows, at first, well-to-do Englishman Haytham Kenway and subsequently his half-Native son Ratonhnhaké:ton, mercifully dubbed Connor by his Murtaugh-esque Assassin mentor. Though directed by different goals, the two come into contact with a precursor key the present-day Assassins badly need to prevent an encroaching solar apocalypse, the mystery behind the ultimate fate of said key necessitating another trip into the Animus for the beleaguered Desmond Miles. Both the plotting and characterization in this game are excellent; from its fidelity in depicting the period's well-established heavyweights such as Commander George Washington, Israel Putnam, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and Lafayette to establishing the personalities of its largely fictionalized central characters. The Templars are more nuanced than they've ever been, wonderfully playing off Connor's idealistic naïvety during the series' customary philosophical discussions with dying targets. The Homestead, a settlement that Connor presides over much like the earlier sidequest-ridden home bases of previous games, has an assortment of salt-of-the-earth characters to whom the player grows accustomed as Connor helps them with their sundry settler struggles. Less well-handled is the game's insistence on including Connor in every major historical event of the war like a superimposed Forrest Gump, as he hovers around the background of the Boston Massacre, the Tea Party and many of the major conflicts. Then again, not allowing the player to take part in these events wouldn't have gone down well either, so I can respect how lead writer Corey May dealt with the dilemma it presented.Many of the game's additions are solid, if a little superfluous. For instance, money is rarely an issue in this game, despite not having the regular windfalls Ezio obtained by investing in every store he came across. So many of the game's cash-raising systems - the hunting, the trade convoys, the Assassin contracts - could all be forgotten about without issue, and frequently were as I was playing. A plethora of side-activities are always appreciated, but I cannot help but feel that the development time each system necessitated might've been better spent elsewhere. This is excepting the one addition I truly did find impressive: The naval sequences. Connor's ship, the Aquila, has several important appearances in the plot but the game also creates an entirely optional chapter and a chain of additional missions based solely on the naval combat, which is in turn both strategically satisfying and cinematically thrilling. Not since Skies of Arcadia have I been so enamored with a game's occasional divergence into ship-to-ship strife.But the major problem still remains; the AC2 system is still as buggy and dysfunctional as it has perhaps ever been, though whether this is due to the new additions compounding pre-existing faults or simply a tweaking that went awry due to a lack of finesse and/or development time I couldn't say for certain. The semi-automated free-running frequently misinterprets the user's commands (having the same button mapped to running and climbing is rather unconducive at times, it turns out), the AI's ability to detect Connor can range from sharply clairvoyant to utterly insensate apparently at random and the game's many, many interesting glitches can elicit reactions ranging from mild bemusement to frustrated restarts. But what really drives these issues home are the bonus requirements for each sequence of the game; the dreaded ""full synchronization"" requisites of AC Brotherhood making another unwelcome return. Intended to provide a challenge for those who wish it in lieu of any traditional difficulty setting, these requirements would be difficult even if the engine was working as intended. Instead, it shines a big ol' spotlight on the many cracks and fissures in the game's mechanics, as issue after issue will inevitably sabotage the nigh-perfect undertakings such requirements demand from the player. Attempting to beat the game with full synchronization is simply an exercise in frustration; it's recommended the player skip as many of these as they wish if they intend to derive any joy from this game. It's a shame, as advising people to skip major parts of the game is rarely complimentary to it as a whole.If you're prepared to look past the game's issues, or are such a fan that they no longer phase you (as many have been present since AC2), then there's a fine game lying underneath. It's a major disappointment in many respects, but these don't extend to the core of what the Assassin's Creed experience is about: Cleverly devised cinematic set-pieces, well-written characters, rewarding timing-based combat and the increasingly ludicrous revelations presented by the overarching present-day narrative. It's not going to win any new proponents, unless they're major American Revolution buffs, but it should just about satisfy its pre-existing fanbase. It would seem like it's due time for the series to take a break and consider a much-needed overhaul, however.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[With Ezio and Altair's story behind us, Ubisoft has moved into a more recognizable time period which features new gameplay mechanics and motivations to lead both players and Desmond to continue working inside the Animus. Assassin's Creed III features a new assassin named Ratonhnhaké:ton, but you can simply call him Connor. As Desmond you will venture around the world looking for special items to help stop the Templars, and Connor's story focuses on stopping templars as well and protecting historic political leaders who shaped the beginnings of our independence.Ubisoft does enough new things to keep veterans of the series invested in the story, while making the game more accessible to new players who may have not taken a leap into these titles.The element that I immediately noticed in AC3 were the game's visuals. Now running on the new 'Anvil' engine, the game features more diverse NPCs on screen than ever before, accompanied by great environmental objects such as trees, boats, wildlife, and realistic weather effects. I don't know what the exact frame rate is, but the game always ran smoothly with my time with it.Throughout the story in the game, many historic battles from our past are depicted in grand form, with hundreds of soldiers viewable with battle effects surrounding the chaos. From the musket firing, yells of wounded soldiers, and the growling of nearby bears, Assassin's Creed III does a great job of immersing you into the mid 1700's time period with tremendous detail.As with past Assassin Creed games, the story is mainly focused on the various ancestors of Desmond Miles, but this time there are more playable sequences that have you controlling Desmond in the modern age of 2012. Both viewpoints are equally engaging and it's nice to play as Desmond and traverse around his current setting utilizing moves learned from his respected ancestors, which Connor has plenty of.The half English and Native American raised Connor can easily traverse through the forest areas with great ease and very swiftly. You'll be able to leap from tree to tree, and give yourself a nice area to attack unsuspecting enemies who may await below you. Add this factor alongside the weapons like the bow and rope, and you'll really be able to down any enemy who stands in your way.The controls in Assassin's Creed III have gotten more simpler, which makes the game more accessible to everyone. Performing counters now only requires the use of one button, and attacking down to two which either uses a short or long ranged item like the bow, pistol, blades, or hatchet. Tougher enemies that you face in the game can't really be countered, and for these guys you'll need to break their defense which is performed by one button as well.Traversing the environment is also a bit more simpler. On Xbox 360, instead of holding the RT and A button to get around, you can simply just hold RT, with A used when you wish to jump or make tougher leaps. No one should have a problem playing Assassin's Creed III.Some of the new gameplay elements that AC3 provides includes Ship battles and hunting. At certain points in the game, you're tasked with taking on hostile ships who aim to sink you, so you'll have to act swiftly. You can alter your speed by changing the ship from half and full sail mode, while maintaining control of the ship. It's all handled fairly easy, with most of the focus on staying in the correct direction of targets.Combat is fairly simple to use in AC3Hunting becomes available in the game fairly quickly after getting control of Connor. It is initially done for tutorial reasons, but later becomes used a mean to build up currency and trading purposes. Most animals that you can hunt require a bit of tracking, which usually boils down to finding and analyzing clues left by the animals. Bigger ones, such as a wolf or bear don't require as much investigation since they will try and attack upon seeing you, but they can be dispatched with quick button presses.It's a nice feature to check out if you want to build up some currency to purchase new items for Connor.Multiplayer is back in this game and although gameplay wise it hasn't changed too much, there is a new co-op mode titled 'Wolf Pack' to check out which can allow for up to four friends and players to see how quickly and varied they can rack up assassinations. Multiplayer will once again require a Uplay pass which comes with a new copy of the game and players who borrow or rent the game can play to a certain level limit. The ranking system is still in effect, so whether in co-op mode or versus multiplayer, you can level up and unlock new items for your character of choice.Assassins Creed III raises the bar high for future AC and other action-adventure titles. There are a few technical glitches here and there, but nothing severe enough to deter from the overall experience. If you decide to give the game a try, you'll be glad that you did.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I really enjoyed the game itself immensely, but was pretty disappointed in the ending. I will try and refrain from using spoilers as much I can. I really hate giving away information to people who are genuinely interested in the game, so if you want to be completely surprised, trust me, you will. Now go buy the game. Other readers / skeptics, continue on.I'll hit on a few downsides to the game, then get to the good stuff.- Glitches. While I hadn't come across more than a handful, glitches are not good to have in a game. Aside from the few that caused me to chuckle at people stuck in terrain, there WAS one that was pretty detrimental. During one of the missions as Desmond, a cut scene sequence failed to happen. This caused me to wander around and walk into crowds without knowing where to go next. While it sidetracked me for only a little while, it was slightly aggravating. Thankfully, it took up only a little of my time and I was able to use the restart from last checkpoint feature and finish the mission fine. The upside to glitches: Well, they didn't hinder *my* gameplay so much. It's a slippery slope to be on, nonetheless.- Horses. OK, the franchise hasn't been the absolute greatest when it comes to horseback riding. While I kind of enjoy the realism, I think even in previous games, they went a little too far. Horses should travel at least a little bit faster and be perhaps a slight bit easier to control. This game was no exception, and in fact seemed to be a step back in the wrong direction.The upside to horses: Riding very optional. I'm having a hard time thinking of any missions that required this.- Similarities to previous Creed games. While this didn't bother me quite as much, I can see where folks would be upset at least. For a series which has mainly got it's toughest criticism for repetitiveness, they did come out with tons of new and original content. However, even though this game is a really fresh and different episode to add to the series, there are a quite a few missions that would have a skeptic player saying ""Well crap, I've done *this* before!"" However, I argue that most of the content is new, fresh and enjoyable. I find it difficult to nitpick at storyline missions that had been done previously in the series. Especially since the new setting, characters, and timeline, along with the amazing new combat system and content gave the game a fresh feel altogether.Upside to similarities and repetitiveness: Well, the last games were awesome, so there's that. I'd also like to point out that a big percentage of the storyline missions had not entirely been done before. The chase missions seemed to take the brunt of repetition.- Ending. I really don't want to give any spoilers, so I'm just going to say that it left much to be desired. At least for me, in any event.Upside to ending: I don't really think there is one, besides room for a fourth installment. Still waiting for the announcement, though. I'm guessing the announcement for the Playstation Orbis (PS4) and the XBOX 720 will come first, however.OK, well, those were the negative points to the game. While they warrant at least a half star off a full perfect score, I found the game incredibly enjoyable. Without further adieu, onto the bright side of things.- Combat system. While it followed a pretty similar concept of dodging blows, parrying attacks with counters and generally staying away from large groups of the more difficult enemies, there was quite a lot of content added into the combat system, and I'm not just talking animations. Ranged weapons were much more frequently found throughout the game. Pretty much 99% of the enemies had a firearm of some sort. While this in a sense made it slightly more challenging, the good news is that Connor can not only wield firearms, but also a bow and arrow. Not to mention, using an opponent as a human shield! Another exciting new thing was the double-counter kill. While perhaps a little cliché in that it would make a kill-cam sequence happen, it was still really awesome to see added into the already souped-up combat style. All this, added with new animations, the addition of various combat techniques (such as switching from Connor's default dual-wield stance [which is also new] to two-handed blunt weapons, ranged, etc.) and the ridiculous ability to kill with ranged weapons in great frequency, makes the combat system one of the better parts of the game as a whole.Downside to the combat system: I really can't think of much. I will go as far to say that the controls for the PS3 are a bit different than the previous installments. But repetition is bad right?- Naval combat. This is a huge addition to the franchise. I really can't say much more than it is really, really awesome (well I could, but I don't want to be a bandwidth hog).Downside to naval combat: There is none, really. I could make an argument that it was mission-based only and not free roam, but how many blu-rays do you think it would take to contain even a portion of the Atlantic Ocean? Yeah. So none, really.- New setting. The American Revolution is a really cool time in history. Well at least for nerds like me, anyway. There's just a ton of awesome to factor into the setting, the timeframe and everything else. Historical names that even non-American citizens would recognize right away, the infamous redcoats, lots of historical places in New York, Boston and in-between (they did a great job with the database as well, by the way).Downside to the new setting: There really isn't any. While it may show the more ""bad guy"" side of some key historical figures, if you really thought these people were saints in the first place, I'm not sure this page is the right place for you anyway. Moving on.I will refrain from making new points, seeing as it might be good to stick to 3 good things and 3 bad things that came to mind regarding this game. (I could pick a looooot more good stuff, and perhaps nitpick a few other things, but bandwidth restraints and such) Just be aware that there are a lot of franchise-new features to this game that I haven't mentioned. I also want to point out that the overall experience is very satisfying, even if you hate the ending like I did. The graphics and atmosphere are really amazing, and it's easy to lose yourself on the Colonial frontier. Overall, I give this game a 4.5 stars. I really want to give it 5 stars, but the ending was a hard pill to swallow. If the game itself were flawless apart from the ending, I would give it a 5 nonetheless. But 4.5 stars is a great score regardless, and I can live with that. I definitely recommend picking up this game soon, even if you are new to the series!]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed III may be the third main title in the Assassin’s Creed series, but it is the fifth over all, that of course is not including any of the handheld games. Ubisoft has done a good job of stripping away some of the unnecessary fat that was starting to thicken up the series in game play and mechanics, but also leave the game with some new stuff to try and make Assassin’s Creed III a little different than what we have been playing the last few years. The downside of this comes with much more bugs and glitches in the game as a whole, more than any of the other games in the series have had altogether. Ubisoft said a small team was developing this title ever sense they finished up the second game while other teams worked on Brotherhood and Revelations and once those were done they all came together to finish three. I can not believe that at all with some of the problems this game has.Assassin’s Creed III, just like all the other games takes the story to a time in our history that no other games ever tread upon and it does a remarkable job of making it fun to play in and tells a relatively well crafted story. The ambition that Ubisoft puts forth in overcoming the challenges for game play and mechanics in this series is defiantly impressive to say the least. This time around the game takes players to the American Revolutionary War as you see some of ’s earliest and most historical events through the eyes of the once again upstart assassin’s guild.The modern day world is the backdrop to the series, although everything that Desmond is learning within the animus from his ancestors is to save the world. A lot of the end game of the past Assassin’s Creed games have done nothing but add more questions to the story as a whole in the modern day in the series. Finally after all this time there was a lot of closer to Desmond and the fight between the modern day assassins and Templars. In addition the whole saving the world aspect that was sprinkled in during modern day missions after the second game has also been tied up. All of this however feels like it was quickly slapped together and shoehorned into the game. Maybe it is because answers to long lasting mysteries, like those that this series creates are never as satisfying as one likes to hope.The modern day story with Desmond still takes a backseat in Assassin’s Creed III much like it was with all the others, however there is much more done with Desmond this time around more than any of the other games. Revelations tried bring more out of Desmond’s story, but failed miserable with horrible first-person platform puzzle levels. In Assassin’s Creed III, Desmond has full on missions he must complete, albeit the reasoning is limited, but the fact that you get to take control of Desmond on missions that almost rival those of the regular missions we have come to love from all the games. It is about time you really get the feeling that Desmond is a true assassin. As he hides in crowds, climbs buildings and fights his way out of trouble with guards.Assassin’s Creed III serves up some daddy issues between Desmond and his father, which at the start is quite annoying, but mixing that with everything going on for Desmond it starts to get its hooks into you as they learn to band together while facing their differences. It also makes there feel like more of a connection between Desmond and the real star of this game, Connor Kenway. He was born of an English man and a Native American woman. He and his tribe live in the Northeast of America during the Revolutionary War. Connor has been caught in the middle of a lot in his years as a young adult, between the assassins and Templars and that of his native people and the European colonists. Connor is quickly thrown in after his first taste of knowledge of the apple and he never looks back as he learns to become an assassin. His unwavering honor for justice and for protecting his people is what makes him such a great character has he has the Revolutionary War pushed upon him.American history always glorified the founding fathers of our nation, but of course the Revolutionary War was like that of any war, which was full of compromises to bad situations at best. Assassin’s Creed III lays some of that out for us, which humanizes some of the icons that we as Americans have looked up to our entire lives. It is an interesting way to look at how the war went at the same time really draws you into the game. Historical moments have always been a huge part of the Assassin’s Creed games, but in Assassin’s Creed III Connor’s story is neatly tied into the actual war itself in ways that the series has rarely approached. Not only are you witnessing historical events like The Boston Tea Party, but Connor actually takes action in all of them. It works well for the most part, but then there are other times such as Connor riding the horse that Paul Revere rode to warn people that the British were coming, situations like that felt shoehorned in, as if Paul Revere was too incompetent to do it on his own. It would have been better to follow along behind him and have to take out any redcoats along the way.The geography of Assassin’s Creed III is very important to mention here. The series spent the majority of its time in eras and places with large buildings, but Assassin’s Creed III look a large step back and that weighed on a lot of peoples mind leading up to the games release. Many people were unsure if climbing and rooftop running would be as fun in cities like Boston and New York in the mid 1700’s with so many low standing buildings and they had the same fear about the tree top running in the open wilderness between cities. It has been a long time since the very first game, but there were some areas in that game that had no tall buildings and in the open areas of the first game between cities hardly had anything at all to climb and that worked out just fine. So it is no real surprise that free running through the towns in Assassin’s Creed III works great and is still a lot of fun. Also the treetop running in the wild is a blast too. Going from tree branch to tree branch is very fluid and works without any hassle. It would have been nice to be able to use more trees in the cities as well while free running.Over the past few games Ubisoft has added a lot of things to do on the side, some might say to the point of over stuffing the player with content, much like some of the issues with Revelations. However in Assassin’s Creed III Ubisoft has take out some of the extra and streamline other content. There is still plenty to do on the side in the third game, although some of it doesn’t feel as fulfilling. There are some liberation missions that you can start up and when you get into these situations they are usually very easy and quick to get through making them feel almost nonexistent. The game does offer some side missions you can do to buildup the homestead, which is the land Connor lives on. Doing these missions will have these people come stay on your land and you can use their goods for things you need or to be able to make things. It is a different approach to the whole banking thing and building up workshops in the last couple of Assassin’s Creed games. It works well and makes the homestead feel cozy when running around hunting animals and being able to stop and talk to these people for more than just to get something out of them. Most of the disconnect from the side missions is brought on by the newer version of fast travel system. A lot of areas you can simply jump from where ever you are to the edge of the city and into the next area, were as the fast travel system of the last couple games you had to find tunnels which made the things available to do around the areas more accessible while running around.This is the third straight Assassin’s Creed game to offer a unique multiplayer and Ubisoft continues to build onto the multiplayer in each iteration. When the multiplayer was first brought to the players in Brotherhood I quickly fell in love with it. It was something completely different and refreshing from anything else out there. Now even though the main concept of the multiplayer has not changed, Ubisoft has added in many things to try to keep players playing online. Now I hardly touched the multiplayer in Revelations, so some of this might have been added in that game. You can customize your favorite characters in many different ways, such as clothing, colors and weapon type. There is even a new sound cues for when you have your target insight or when the person targeting you is closing in on you. There is also a new co-op structure to the multiplayer called “Wolf Pack”. I have not yet played this mode, but it appears to be a wave based horde mode for you and your friends to assassinate bad guys.Assassin’s Creed III had big shoes to fill and it did a good job of it, ignoring many of the games glitches and bugs. They story was told very well, although it had a very slow start to it. The characters are well developed, the scenery is amazing and the idea of taking control of an assassin during the Revolutionary War was great. It may not be Assassin’s Creed at its finest, Assassin’s Creed III had some missteps throughout the game, but the characters, story and gameplay make it easy to turn a blind eye to a lot of it and the mechanics are successful enough for introducing some new game play elements.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I have always had a place in my heart for Assassins Creed. I feel a certain kind of connection to the story, having spent countless hours collecting, purchasing, and most importantly, stabbing my way through five games. I thought the previous game (Revelation) was a sadly predictable wringing out of the Assassin sponge and was curious, though a bit put off, by AC III.So, was it any good?If you want the quick answer, than yes it was. I thoroughly enjoyed slicing my way through a well defined era. Who doesn't want to ride with Paul Revere? (Me, I am Canadian). I am not from the states nor do I live in the US, so the whole thing lost a bit of the awe factor that I sense was meant for US citizens. Nonetheless, It was a well crafted world, the best I think this generation of consoles will be able to pull off, aside from, maybe, GTA V.The game has an immediately memorable opening sequence in a theater in London, circa 1700s. It is extremely atmospheric and the game opening ends with a great twist. At the same time I seems to take forever to get going, as the pacing is skewed horribly.Well I found Conners story very enjoyable in Revolutionary America, I thought Desmond's story ran off without a satisfying ending. It was a huge let down to see everything the series has been building to swept away so swiftly you hardly can believe its happening, to quote Clint, even while its happening.Something that the game failed horribly at was trying to patchwork together a comfortable system of story missions and side activities. We are not talking a crash and burn, but I felt absolutely no draw to complete anything except the story. We are talking about a series veteran who spent a ton of time doing side missions in previous entries. It felt hidden away under a thin veil, and when you just want to play it is hard to dig out. I felt like I missed out on something afterwords, but did not feel compelled to go back and beat everything.The gameplay is nearly identical with some minor tweaks here and there. I never liked the climbing in AC, I never found it entertaining, aside from the first few hours of the first game. It always felt detached and crooked and I have never enjoyed it. It is essentially the same system here, just a bit tweaked to climb a few trees and some rock faces and climb slightly faster. That being said, climbing up a tree and onto a cliff is pretty cool.In Ubisoft's attempts to streamline everything I think they have edged away from a key factor to the game. Though I can't really put a name to it. The cities feel better, but less grand, less characterized and much more simple. The economy feels severely dumbed down from Brotherhoods excellence. Everything just lacks that indefinable hook. It feels more simple and nature-like, less unique and memorable. The puzzle feels like it is missing a piece.Overall, I loved the story with Conner, loved stabbing dudes, loved the setting, loved the game, well, mostly. I hated the ending, disliked the wandering Desmond story, found some monotonousness, some really bad pacing a handful of technical issues like a choppy frame rate in town. This is not the stunning finale to one of my favorite series, it lacked a bang, it lacked character, it ended poorly, but at the same time there is a level of great craftsmanship that cannot be so ignorantly pushed aside.It IS astounding what they packed into the world, BUT in a shining example it is proof that it takes more than millions of dollars and teams of hundreds of people to give a game that special feeling. I so badly wanted this game to go over the top into one of the greats, but it just can't quite climb the fence. The formula is messed with, and it is still a winning formula, but for a guy who has spent a great deal of time with AC the formula got a bit tiresome, even with a great deal of production value.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I was looking forward to Assassin's Creed III as much as any title this year. The American Revolution seemed like a really compelling location and the hope for some basic changes to the somewhat tired Assassin's Creed series. Revelations had a very superfluous feel to it and I was hoping that this would lead to a change with the change of scenery, protagonist (OK, you're still Desmond, but different assassin, obviously).I was terribly, terribly disappointed. This game might make my list as one of the my 10 most disappointing games in recent history.The game does not have a lack of things to do. There is a remarkably wide and diverse array of things to do --- it's just that a lot of them are not that much fun to do. Hunting was surprisingly unenjoyable. The naval battles were...OK, I cannot lie and claim that I thought it'd be fun because naval battles never are. They did all that you can do with naval battles, but the pacing of naval battles limits what they can do. The things you have to do to get people to reside in your homestead just seem unbelievably banal for a game where you're an assassin neck deep in the American Revolution. Going from stalking Templar leaders to herding pigs seems to be a bit of a dramatic change in import. The biggest problem with all of the extras is that they are not much fun to do. The liberation missions seem pointless outside of it being the way to get new assassin recruits. Collecting the feathers and pages of Franklin's almanac isn't fun either. Getting trinkets for Peg Leg isn't a rip roaring fun time either. Trying to run caravans to make money isn't fun...but one of the more enjoyable parts of the last few titles, building up your Assassin Guild, gets barely a mention (and levelling up is such a long-term chore that it is just a grind). They have some really baffling choices here and they seem to misfire on most of them.It's also a technical mess as framerate drops precipitously more than once. That is a limitation on the consoles however. The next gen AC titles should be pretty solid affairs.The game starts as slowly as almost as slow any game I've ever played. I can appreciate the dramatic intent but it was a chore to play for the first several hours. That alone deeply hurts the game. You cannot be an awesome game if you are so tedious for so long. And they treat you as if you have never touched an Assassin's Creed title and while I like that they expect newcomers to come in, it'd be lovely if they allowed people who have ever played the game to skip the seemingly never-ending tutorials.Desmond's stand out like sore thumbs. They just seem to be there to simply change the visual style. Short levels of not-that-great sneaking just aren't going to cut the mustard here.It's sad that these problems exist because the storyline is actually really solid and once it gets going (admittedly, more than halfway through the game) it moves at a nice pace. The cutscenes are really good. I am tired of games forcing you to walk slowly while it unloads some dialogue on you (why have a marginally interactive scene as opposed to a totally non-interactive one? Marginally interactive is worse) but I can't hold a poor game convention against this game too badly. The visuals are amazing. It's a really good game base with a ton of annoying problems that overwhelm the positives.At full price, this isn't worth the money. At a reduced rate, yeah, definitely. It's attempt to expand the game turned the game from good to mediocre. It's somewhat sad.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[When Assassin’s Creed 2 came out, it was a huge leap forward for the series and it was almost a different game that the first game. Over the years since then, Ubisoft has refined the game systems and generally made improvements. With Assassin’s Creed 3, I was hoping that there would be another huge change in the way this game was played and while there are some nice changes, its not as big a change as it was from 1 to 2. Is that a bad thing? Read on to find out!GameplayI’ll start out with the combat, which had gone through a few changes. For the most part, it largely the same as you will be spending a fair amount of time waiting for someone to attack you so you can counter. The biggest change is what happens after you make the initial counter. In previous games you counter and immediately kill with your equipped weapon. In AC3, you make the counter and time slows down for a few seconds while you decide to kill with your main weapon, your secondary weapon, break the attackers defence or throw them. After the initial kill, you can then continue to chain your kills using primary/secondary weapons with style. The nice thing about this change is that its not just for looks, there are different enemy types and each of them must be taken out in a different way. Some must be killed with your secondary weapon, while for others you need to break their defence before moving in for the kill. All of the animations for this game are new and very gratifyingly brutal as Conner (the new Assassin) will really throw himself into his kills. The animations are so well done that you can almost feel him bury his tomahawk into a persons skull, or break someone’s back. Some of the weapons you will be using are familiar (hidden blades, sword) and some are new, like the aforementioned tomahawk and the rope dart. You also have access to pistols, which raises an interesting question: if this is during the American Revolution, doesn’t everyone have guns? Yes, all soldiers have guns but you have to remember that it took a long time to reload those guns. The military wasn’t bouncin through the streets packin SMG’s or something. All guns in this game are single shot, then the NPC’s (and you) must go through the process of ripping open a pouch of gunpowder, pouring the powder into the gun, loading a musket ball into the gun and then pushing it down the barrel with a long piece of metal. When someone is lining up a shot against you a yellow icon will appear over their head. When you see this you have a few seconds to grab an enemy and use him as a human shield which will block all incoming fire and then give you a chance to close the gap while the other guys try to reload their guns.The stealth in this game works pretty much the same as all other Assassin’s Creed games. You can still blend with the crowd, though in this game you can blend with any two people. You will still also make use of hay bails, wells, roof gardens etc to hide. There are a couple of new systems implemented for stealth, one of which is the “stalking zone”. These are areas with tall grass, or small bushes that you can hide and freely move around in. You can also assassinate from these like any other hiding spot but unlike other hiding spots, it’s very easy to move from one stalking zone to another so you can move in closer to your prey. The other new mechanic (to this series anyway) is being able to lean up against a wall and whistle to get someone’s attention, then assassinate them from around the corner. It’s nothing revolutionary but it helps when trying to stay stealthy and i don’t know why it’s making its first appearance in this game.And of course the big staple in these games is the climbing. The cities of Boston and New York is where you will be jumping from rooftop to rooftop, though because they weren’t really built up as much it makes it tougher to go from building to building without running into large gaps that force you to the ground or make you go way out of your way. It’s a little sad since going from rooftop to rooftop in previous games was a lot of fun and it kinda sucks that when I was in a city I mostly just used a horse to get around, only using the rooftops when it helped me complete an objective. But if you’ve been following coverage on this game at all you’ll know that rooftops are not the main focus for climbing in this game, no sir, it’s the tree climbing that is the star. There is a huge world outside of the main cities called the Frontier and your main way of getting around will be the trees. Scattered throughout the frontier there are trees that can be climbed and then you can start free-running along the branches. It may worry you to think about that but trust me, it works pretty well. All of the tree-running is quick and super slick. You only need to press the trigger and hold forward and Connor will run along/swing from branches, glide around tree trunks and leap from branch to branch with easy and fluidity. Another type of climbing in this game is the cliff climbing. You can scale almost any cliff and Ubisoft did a really great job on making cliff walls look natrual. Ubisoft created a new system for this game called “Safe Free-Running”. Basically this means that while you are free-running Connor will never jump from a height that would kill him, which has been an issue in the past. While this does stop unnecessary deaths, it does not alleviate all of the frustrations as Connor will still make jumps you don’t want him to, they just won’t kill you. Another climbing issue I was hoping to see fixed is the one where the character simply stops climbing even though there is clearly a handhold for him to grab onto. To fix this, you have to go back a little ways and then approach the area again for the game to realize there was a path up. I was really hoping these issues would be fixed and it’s sad they couldn’t resolve them for this game.Assassin’s Creed 3 also has an abundance of side stuff to do. There is a whole new hunting system in play. You can track and hunt down animals using bait or snares, or you can just simply air assassinate them from a tree. Once you’ve made the kill you can then skin the animal and sell their various parts for cash, or use them in the games all new crafting system. There is also an area called the Homestead that you can build up during your journey. You will meet people of varying professions in your travels and can invite them to live on the homestead which opens up various side quests and increases the quality of items you can craft. I really enjoyed the Homestead as the more homestead missions you do, the more you build a relationship with the people living there and at the end it really felt like a big family. It’s also a nice place to go where you don’t have to worry about being attacked by soldiers and can just relax in a tree. There are also feathers, trinkets and almanac pages to find throughout the world so if you’re a collector you’ll love it. The bad thing about the side stuff in this game is that none of it really gets you anything. The collectables just unlock outfits or weapons but in a game where there is no armour and weapon damage doesn’t matter, why bother? Like I said, if you’re a collector then you’ll love it, but if you are looking for some reward that will help with combat you’re better off not doing it at all as it will just waste your time. I personally collected all of the feathers and the trinkets just because I like collecting, but at the end I felt disappointed because the costume that was unlocked didn’t look that great and it didn’t grant me any bonuses like the armour of Altair or Brutus.And last, but not least is the all new navy combat system. During these missions you take control of your ship, the “Aquila” and perform varying tasks. Most involve blowing up other ships, while a few take you to locations that are similar to the crypts found in Assassin’s Creed 2. It may sound strange for a game like this, but it was a lot of fun steering my ship around and lining up the cannons to take out ships. Or ramming giant war-ships so they could be boarded.I didn’t do a whole lot of the ship missions (which I regret), but I am looking forward to doing them when I go back to the game.Sadly I cannot talk about this game without talking about the numerous glitches I encountered while playing. Some of these were not very game breaking, like groups of people or animals simply disappearing into thin air. Some of the more annoying glitches were things like map icons not appearing, or restricted zones not being marked so I would get attacked instantly upon walking into a seemingly random area. There was also a glitch were I started getting attacked during a cut-scene. I couldn’t do anything but watch as Connor was smacked around until he died and I had to reload a checkpoint. I also got stuck in a tree which made me reload. One very annoying glitch happened when I had to kill someone, then loot his body afterwards. I killed the guy, which made the guards attack me. As soon as I finished killing the guards, the body I was supposed to loot vanished and I failed the missions as there was no body to loot any more. This happened a few times and was very frustrating. I understand that even the best of games will have it’s glitches, but the amount encountered and the frequency in which they are encountered is inexcusable. This is a game that has been in production for almost 3 years and it should not have this many issues.StoryWarning: The following section may contain minor spoilers for previous Assassin’s Creed gamesAs with previous Assassin’s Creed games, there are two story lines running parallel to each other. One plot line takes place in the modern day world. After coming out of a coma-like state in Revelations, Desmond teams up with his father and two other assassins from the previous games (Shaun and Rebecca) to save the world from a solar flare that threatens to scorch the Earth and bring about the end of the world. They have received this information from “The ones who came before” who were a highly advanced race that existed before humans, and were unable to stop a similar event from happening in the past. In order to stop this from happening they need to find a key to a temple and to do that they have to, you guessed it, shove Desmond back into the Animus to re-live one of his ancestors memories. The ancestor this time around is a half British, half Native-American named Connor. Connor’s story starts when he is a child living with his tribe in the woods. Everything is fine and dandy until one day the Templars show up and do him some serious wrong. After that he finds his way to an old assassin master who agrees to train Connor to fight the Templars. It sounds cliche, but what has always made these stories interesting is the setting in which they take place. As I said before this takes place during the american revolution and it treads down the “Alternate History” path which makes the story more interesting. Instead of watching the events of the revolution from the side-lines you actually take part in them. You toss tea overboard during the Boston Tea party, join in on the Boston Massacre and take to the front lines during some of the pivotal battles of the revolution. The pacing of the story was pretty good (about as good as it can get in an open world game), there were a few twists and the ending closed it off in a very nice way. Overall I would say I enjoyed Connors story. The same, sadly, cannot be said for Desmonds. I have never really cared for the future/Desmond story and that is mostly due to the fact that it is given the least amount of time in the games and that it is telling a story on two fronts (at least in this game). On one side, you’ve got the Templar threat and on the other you’ve got the whole apocalypse thing. Both are huge issues and they deserve more game time than they do. What this resulted in was an ending that felt rushed and very disappointing and honestly I think the Assassin’s Creed games would have all been better without the future story line at all. Or better yet, what if they left that part out till the very end? What if you played through all of these games thinking they were just set in those time periods, and then at the end its revealed that you’ve been seeing all this through Desmond’s eyes and from there continue to make a game or two centred only on Desmond and the future. It would give the developers much more time to invest into Desmond and I think it may have worked for the better.CharactersConnor is probably one of my favorite characters in this game aside from one other who I won’t get into due to spoilers. Connor is a no-nonsense type of guy. Someone who sees everything as black and white; you’re either a good guy or a bad guy and if you’re a bad guy you best stay out of his way. Connor doesn’t take sides as far as the american revolution goes, he does what he sees to be right no matter who is on the wrong end of his blade. Because of this way of thinking it makes Connor very naive and even when confronted with a situation that appears to be a shade of grey, he sticks to his beliefs and does what he thinks is the right thing to do. Some people view this as a negative, and I can see why; Connor never really goes through any kind of major character arc. At the end of the story, he is pretty much the same guy as at the beginning and I don’t think this is a bad thing at all. Sure, it’s nice to see a character change and grow through their story, but there’s something to be said about a character who doesn’t waver in his beliefs and stays true to them no matter what situation presents itself. Connor isn’t all violence and revenge though, if you play through the homestead missions you will see that he is also a very friendly, caring and giving individual. He does not believe in owning land and ends up building a great community on his homestead filled with people who call him their friend.Other than Connor and the one person I won’t talk about there aren’t many characters that stand out in my mind. You meet some of the main guys in the american revolution like George Washington and Sam Adams which is cool, but since these aren’t original characters, there is only so much you can do with their stories.The WorldUbisoft did a great job creating a massive open world for you to play around in. There are four main areas: Boston, New York, the Frontier and the Homestead. Boston and New York look really great and from what I have seen, they put a lot of effort into re-creating it as closely to the original as possible. The streets are much wider, so you don’t get big groups of random people walking along, but the people who are there feel like more than just wandering crowds. People will have conversations with each other, haggle with vendors and do various other day to day tasks that breathe life into the cities. The Frontier and Homestead are out in the wilderness with little towns and forts dotted here and there and the rest is filled with just as much life as the cities. There are many different types of animals you’ll run into in the wild and they are all very life like. Sometimes I would just sit in a tree and watch what animals will do when left to their own devices. Elk will engage in a fight, grunting and butting heads with each other, wolves stalk their prey and baby deer leap around playfully as their mothers keep a watchful eye. It’s great to see that Ubisoft was willing to put so much effort into making their world feel full of life and it’s something I intend to enjoy more of.VisualsThis is the best look Assassin’s Creed game, hands down. The towns are very well detailed and the game really shines with you are out on the Frontier, looking out over the landscape from the top of a tall tree or from a cliff with a waterfall running over it. When you play this game, do yourself a favour and just stop to look around and enjoy the view. You won’t regret it. Sadly the games nice looks is also somewhat of a downfall. It looks fine most of the time when your in the Frontier, but get into a city where there is a lot going on, and you’ll notice that there is almost always a layer of fog off in the distance, covering up anything that is going on and giving the system a break from rendering too much. I guess it’s just a limitation of the current gen hardware but it would have been nice if they could have found some way around this.SoundI enjoyed most of the music in this game. The main title theme in particular stands out for me and I might even try to get my hands on it to listen to outside of the game. The music that played when you stepping into a tavern was also well done and really made me feel like I was actually there (even though I have obviously never been to a tavern in that era). The rest of the music was decent and always fir the current situation. Sadly I don’t think any of it compared to some of the stuff done by the composer for the last few games; Jesper Kyd. Dont get me wrong, Lorne Balfe did a good job, I just don’t think I will be looking to purchase a copy of the soundtrack.Voice work for the game was pretty well done and believable for that time period. The main issue I had was with Connor who sometimes sounded like he was just reading from a page. I watched some behind the scenes stuff before the game came out and I know that they had people who could actually speak the native language used in the game, but I’m not sure if that’s just how they spoke or if the voice actor was just having trouble.All of the sounds effects were great, and I want to give a special shout out to the sounds made when stabbing guys (especially the sound made when burying your tomahawk into a skull) and the satisfying crunch made when stepping through the snow.In ClosingSo, was Assassin’s Creed 3 as big a leap from 2 as 2 was from 1? The short answer is no, but that doesn’t mean that this game does not warrant its own number after the title. The refined combat, tree-running, brand new animations and naval combat all grant this game permission to fly the number 3. There are also several other things I didn’t get into, like the change in seasons which force you to change your tactics and the way you travel. Sadly the two big things holding this game back from true greatness are all the random glitches, and the rushed feel of the future story ending. Despite those shortcomings, I still pumped 27 hours into this game and after writing this review I want to go back for more. And there is something to be said about that.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed III is the most dramatic overhaul in the series. It proudly features a new engine with streamlined controls, revamped combat, and reworked animations, among a host of other changes. It introduces a groundbreaking new setting with unflinching, unromanticized depictions of history. It promises to finally deliver on Desmond's potential and end his part in the overarching storyline.Assassin's Creed III is also a total disaster from start to finish.Many of the game's problems are subjective, just matters of personal taste. But many are not, as evidenced by the unbelievable notes for the game's Thanksgiving patch. Fixes range from ""let's try and stop players from falling through the map"" to ""this mission is unreasonably hard. Let's do something about that."" Plain and simple, Ubisoft released an unfinished game, and not even the substantial day-one patch could fix it all.I encountered floating objects, disappearing civilians, scripting errors, broken AI routines, a grinding framerate, and total system hard locks as I trudged through the game. Just watch as my Assassin recruit fails to kill two random guards for the fourth time:It is a broken game, yet surprisingly enough, that's not even its biggest failure.The game stumbles right from the start with a video that summarizes all the previous games and makes a strong case for why there's no reason for us to play as any more of Desmond's ancestors... just moments before Desmond literally says, ""ah, not again,"" faints, and enters the memories of yet another ancestor. At best, it's just one more cheap speed bump on a road littered with cheap speed bumps that prevent the main plot from moving forward, and weak justification for the game's very existence at worst.More frustrating than that, though, is how none of the characters in the present ever address how Desmond murdered Lucy at the end of Brotherhood until a couple of easily skippable, throwaway lines many hours into the game. Apparently, nothing you learned in Revelations was relevant at all to the main plot except its $10 ""Lost Archive"" downloadable content, which is pretty vital stuff if you played through Brotherhood and wanted to know how Lucy's death would be handled.Similarly, the game barely introduces Desmond's father, the current leader of the Assassins, or Daniel Cross, a Templar sleeper agent who murdered the previous Assassin leader and is responsible for the near-complete destruction of the Assassin Order, neither of whom have been in previous games. Put it this way: if you don't know what ""The Great Purge"" is, you might want to do some homework before jumping into Assassin's Creed III to really get the most out of it. For all the game does to prepare players new to the series, it does a terrible job preparing veteran players.From there, it's about six hours before you don the familiar Assassin hood and you're playing the game you probably assumed you'd be playing right from the start. There's an interesting twist early on that almost completely justifies how boring the introductory hours of the game are, but it's also an unearned twist that the game achieves by outright lying to the player during one mission.I beat Assassin's Creed III in a little over 12 hours, and for the first six hours, I was being tossed from one tutorial to the next. Imagine that: six hours of tutorials. That's half the game. That's an entire Call of Duty campaign. That's The Dark Knight, twice.This is a series in desperate need of focus. There's padding everywhere. It's an incredibly bloated experience full of all sorts of story beats and gameplay mechanics and mundane missions that simply aren't needed, would be laughed at in any other medium, and add nothing to core concept of assassinating people.For instance, you can build up your ""homestead"" by hiring different kinds of artisans, like a farmer, a lumberer, and a blacksmith, and level up each by doing favors for them. You can craft recipes for items that you trade through caravans to get more materials for crafting. You can engage in naval warfare to unlock new trade routes to make trading more profitable. You can hunt animals and collect their pelts to use for crafting and trading. These are whole systems that I avoided completely (with the exception of naval warfare, but only because those missions were marked by Templar icons, so I thought I was advancing the plot in some way instead of just wasting my time) because they have nothing to do with assassinating people.I guess that's to be expected when you consider that the protagonist, Ratonhnhaké:ton, isn't even an Assassin. Sure, he'll eventually put on the hood and look the part, but he is not an Assassin. He doesn't believe in the cause or care about the Order. He barely cares about fighting Templars. Really, all he wants is to protect his village from all the encroaching white people.And that's where the game gets really bad: with its haphazard, factually inaccurate, extremely judgmental depiction of history. When Ubisoft Montreal said that Assassin's Creed III is not a pro-America game, they weren't kidding. On a surface level, it absolutely is. You'll predominantly be killing British soldiers, working with colonists, and replacing British flags with American ones. But actually, there's a much deeper undercurrent of thinly veiled hatred toward America lurking just below the surface that's almost impossible to avoid.Ratonhnhaké:ton is a fiercely self-righteous idealist through and through, but ultimately nothing more than a conduit meant to channel Ubisoft Montreal's disgust at America's history with slavery. The game comes back again and again to the hypocrisy of the colonists fighting for freedom while simultaneously engaging in slave trading. The game pathetically trots out historical figures like Samuel Adams to try to defend it half-heartedly with weak rationalizations, but eventually drops all pretense with a lengthy conversation between Desmond and his British ally, Shaun, where Shaun lambasts America's founding fathers and follows it up with an in-game email subtly titled ""American Politics."" I'm sure you can guess the content of that email.Did you know that the Mohawk tribe to which Ratonhnhaké:ton belongs to in the game also engaged in slavery? You probably wouldn't if you trusted Assassin's Creed III's skewed version of history where all white people were bad and all Native American people were good. Then again, I don't know why anyone would trust a game that literally renames its protagonist ""Connor"" because his actual name is too hard to pronounce to not be racist itself. Regardless, slavery was an accepted practice at the time exercised by just about everyone and it doesn't make sense to retroactively judge it using moral standards of today.There are plenty of other factual inaccuracies, like uniforms and flags being used before they would have been created or grossly modified versions of well-documented historical events. It all culminates in a mission that is both ridiculous and annoying where Ratonhnhaké:ton is literally on the horse with Paul Revere as he makes his famous Midnight Ride, tasking you with steering the horse in whichever direction Revere yells in your ear to go. Again, subtlety is not this game's strong suit.So yeah, on top of everything else, the game's not much fun, either. The controls have been simplified to the point that it feels like you have no real control over the character, which is the opposite direction the series has needed to go for a long time. It tries so hard to let you hold one button and go anywhere that it inevitably ends up being extremely clunky and constantly misinterprets your inputs. You'll scramble up the side of a tree or cling to the wall of a tight alleyway in the middle of a chase and lose your target. The game needed to segregate the running and climbing commands to different buttons, but instead, it interlocked them tighter than ever.Combat is the same way. Ratonhnhaké:ton is a vicious fighter, and he doesn't really need your help to do it. There are tons of really cool, really brutal animations that want nothing more than for you to sit back, stop pressing buttons, and appreciate them like a museum piece. This is a game that resents player input.But I can't think of a much better example to demonstrate how backward some of the game's systems are than to just show off how the fast travel works:Assassin's Creed III is absolutely baffling in how poor the fundamental design can be.After recently coming off of Dishonored, a game that encourages players to have a unique approach to each mission and gives them the tools and space to do so, Assassin's Creed III felt claustrophobic. There's nothing inherently wrong with taking a linear approach to mission design, but the missions here just aren't fun. Very few of them even involve assassinating a high-profile target, more often opting to have you eavesdrop on moving targets, perform busywork for other characters, or directly intervene in a historical event in whatever way makes the least amount of sense, like having Ratonhnhaké:ton command colonial troops in battle.Ratonhnhaké:ton's story is rarely exciting, so I jumped at any opportunity to play as Desmond instead and advance the main plot. But even Desmond is a bust in this game.Since the first Assassin's Creed, there's been an implied promise that, at some point, you'll play as Desmond in modern times, roaming a modern city, and assassinating modern Templars. And given that Ubisoft explicitly said that ""you're going to see a lot of Desmond. More so than in any past game,"" I had assumed that meant that they were finally making good on that promise. Not so. Desmond gets a few missions, but only one of them is the least bit interesting, all of them are poorly executed, and his story wraps up in such a rushed, unsatisfying way that I could barely believe that the credits were already rolling.If you do make it that far in the game, though, make sure to stick around for the heavy-handed epilogue after the credits so Ubisoft Montreal can bash you over the head one last time with its political agenda.Assassin's Creed III is the weakest game in the series yet and a clear sign that it's time to give the franchise a break and refocus before it becomes completely irrelevant. There will be an Assassin's Creed game next year, but there shouldn't be.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Well, it's finally here. Assassin's Creed 3. If I spent anymore time anticipating this game, I probably would have flunked out of school.And why shouldn't I have been excited? We have before us 4 extremely above average games that managed to innovate more given their production periods than any other series I know of, and we were promised a BIGGER leap from AC2 to AC3 than from AC1 to AC2 (that's saying a whole lot).But then we have AC3. I wanted this to be amazing so badly. ""Please don't suck"" was the subject of all my youtube comments on the Sneak Peak videos because I don't want AC to turn into Need for Speed when it comes to innovation. Review spoiler alert: It did turn into Need for Speed when it comes to innovation.Okay, less block text, more reviewingGraphics: 6/10 The multiple-character rendering is an impressive feat, but this game has more graphical bugs than any game should have to deal with.Sound: 5/10 Nothing good worth mentioning here. They REMOVED the feature of awesome ambient music in the singleplayer. The ONLY time you hear music outside of scripted mission riffs is when completing a viewpoint.Gameplay: Can't just do a number just yet, gotta break the hate down:Combat: 8/10 The only improvement AC3 made over any of the previous games.Missions: 5/10 Boring and/or frustrating. There is one way to play every mission that is correct. The level of handholding is offensively bad here.Side-Missions: 4/10 Stupidly worse than in previous games. These missions are stale ""kill this gaurd"" or ""pickpocket this guy"" or talk to this guy"" missions that have no personality. MAJOR GRIPE: It took me until Sequence TEN to notice that there WERE any side missions because:1. You are never told what viewpoints accomplish2. No side-mission Icons appear on the screen unless you walk up to them and start them3. You are never told to press back to look at the missions available4. You are bombarded by IMMERSION-DESTRUCTIVE prompts 24/7 early on that disenchant you to doing anything but the tepid story. (You have new email? REALLY?)5. If any of the above are false, it is because I was too bored and frustrated to pay attention to the dude explaining it.Mechanics: 1/10 All the new ones are awful, and all the old ones we loved were either REMOVED OUTRIGHT, left unexplained, or done WORSE than the previous iterations. Name anything you liked from the previous games and I will tell you how this game screwed it in the eye-socket.Multiplayer: 1-10/10 I love AC multiplayer, and this is basically a carbon copy of the previous ones. 1/10 because nothing is new here, 10/10 because I love it still. 5/10 then, I guess.Overall Gameplay is about 4.6/10What I'm Really trying to say:Look at Skyrim, a great game hated early on because of bugs. Bugs were fixed and the game is wonderful now. Mass Effect was hated because of it's ending, and fans were given a new set of endings because the rest of the story was so goddamn good; now the game is highly praised. Modern Warfare 3 was expected to be a small improvement over the second, and when people realized that they were expecting too much to be changed in a series that aims to do no such thing, the reviews improved. AC3 is a game with ALL of these severely crippling problems, and NONE of them are salvageable. The game is what it is and I wish it was never made. I never in my wildest dreams anticipated that I would write such things, and I am extremely disappointed. This is my Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 review on crack. It's so mindbogglingly worse than previous that you have to wonder just what the heck the devs were thinking. If I haven't conveyed it yet, this game which was supposed to leap and bound past its predecessors actually leaps BACKWARDS all the way past AC1.If you need me, I will be at my Xbox, with AC Brotherhood put in. I will have my eyes closed, tearing up slightly, as I pretend that it is AC3.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I've neglected to write this review for the past two weeks because I've felt so strongly about my disappointment for what this game boils down to in the final hour(s), but after thinking long and hard, I can't sit in silence any longer. Note that this review will be full of spoilers, so if you haven't played the game yet, and you are brave enough, you can dive in, but note that I'm warning you here, Assassin's Creed III is a huge let down.When I started my journey into the world of Assassin's Creed III, I was blown away by some of the detail on the characters during cutscenes. Ubisoft really outdid themselves at times in this game, yet at other times the game's graphics just don't stick with it. The first thing you'll notice, several hours in, is that graphical glitches and pop-in's abound in this game. They get bad enough at one point, that I had to ask myself ""how many hours did this game get play tested?"" It just seems like they really quickly rushed this game out at the end, when it could have really used an extra six months of polish.That sums up a lot of my thoughts on everything experienced here. AC3 wastes no time setting up the story for the new hero, Connor Kenway, in fact, the first four hours of the game have you playing as Connor's father. It's a bold move, but it really does pay off for the first half of the story. In fact, up until the final two sequences of this game, I loved just about every minute of the story. While I won't share the fanatic surprise that is dropped on players at the end of the sequences involving Connor's father, I will say that AC3 does a good job of backing up and legitimizing the character of Connor Kenway, which is especially a breath of fresh air since we've had three games with Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. The setting of this game, The American Revolution, is also a fantastic idea on paper, but it really didn't pan out as well as I had hoped. The game hasn't removed itself far from the weaponry and concepts invoked in the previous entries of this series, and the combat camera this time around is completely awful. I'm not sure how this changed since the previous games, but here the camera is so awful that I found it leading to my untimely death several times. Combat also seems a bit of a mess this time around. No longer is combat as fluid as something like Batman: Arkham City, instead I found myself occasionally having to hit the same attack button two or three times before it would register. Putting combat aside, one thing that really took me out of the experience is there was a constant audio sync problem rampant through this entire game. Many times over I would watch a cutscene in which characters voices weren't matched up with their mouths, and this really annoyed me. It was especially annoying during the final moments of the game, and we'll get to that next.The biggest issue I have with AC3 is..., (and this is the big, SPOILERS HERE ALERT, so if you don't' want to know, look away now), how this game ends. Rather then give you something to look forward to for an inevitable sequel, instead the game's ending is a gigantic cop out, not only for Assassin's Creed III, but for the entire franchise. While I've always enjoyed the real-world aspect of this franchise, I also always hoped for a full on Assassin's Creed starring Desmond Miles. But, thanks to AC3's wish-wash ending, that's all been killed because they simply, kill off Desmond Miles. That's right, he's dead. Through a scene that is not only confusing, but simply feels like it was written in a rush, Desmond Miles sacrifices his life for the sake of all human kind, thus ending this franchise. To add to the misery, during the credits, the alien lady (I forget her name, and it really isn't important) explains that while Desmond has now done his part, it's time for her to do her's. Gigantic failure on all accounts there. To add even further putdown, the final mission was almost unplayable, as it had me chasing an enemy through a fire, when I clearly shouldn't have been walking through this fire, the game told me I should! I had to look up a video to figure out that no, that's the wrong way.Rounding out AC3 is the always-felt-tacked-on multiplayer mode. It's a cool concept, I'll give you that, but here it feels broken. The absurd reach that players have by hitting x on their controller to assassinate and the game gifting that person the kill is ridiculous. Wolf Pack mode really isn't that great either. 1 Minute for four people to assassinate a bunch of targets? Not enough time, that's for sure.To be honest, at this point I'm officially writing off this franchise. I think Assassin's Creed II was the high point for this series, and this installment has completely crushed everything I loved about this franchise, in story, and overall gameplay mechanics. I always dreamed of a real-world Assassin's Creed, and now I know that it will never happen. Time to move on, Ubisoft. Let's hope you don't ruin anymore of your franchises.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[With Assassin’s Creed III being the first properly numbered sequel since 2009’s Assassin’s Creed II, some major changes are to be expected. Assassin’s Creed III finally ditches Europe and hits the shores of colonial America, where the backdrop of the Revolutionary War plays a vital part. Ezio Auditore steps out of the spotlight and Ratohnhaké:ton, or Connor as we’ll call him, takes the role of lead assassin. While these changes were needed for a franchise that was beginning to show its wear, some of these replacements don’t always serve to the game’s benefit. However, the modifications made to the gameplay makes Assassin’s Creed III easily the most fun to play in the series. It’s hard to deny the great moment to moment action of the game, even if the some of the periphery surrounding it isn’t as compelling as prior installments.Requiescat in pace... Wait, wrong game.For those unacquainted with the story of the Assassin’s Creed, jumping headlong into this one might not be best way to fully comprehend what in the holy hell is happening. Assassin’s Creed III does offer a short video in the beginning summarizing the events of the previous games, but the intricacies of the plot will probably go over anybody’s head not intimately familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Desmond and his crew of modern assassins in the real world are trying to prevent a major catastrophe from happening, and using the Animus to relive Connor’s life is the key to stopping this destruction. While the story of Desmond may be confounding to newer players, the tale of Connor and his struggles is a fresh one that any person will be able to understand right off the bat. Connor is a Native American trying to fend off the incoming pressure from both the colonies and the Brits from taking over his village’s rightfully owned land. Of course, this plot will end up involving the Templars and Assassins, and I’ll let you guess which side of the Revolutionary War the Templars are on. The story ends up being fascinating and the twists and turns it goes through keeps it suspenseful and interesting throughout. I really had only one problem with the story, but it was a somewhat of a big issue: Connor himself.It's too bad Connor's such a blank slate. But he's sure adept at murdering fools!Connor comes off as a person who has a single motivation, but no personality surrounds that goal. He is so laser focused on his purpose that he becomes a person with absolutely no charm or character. Don’t get me wrong--Connor is a total badass, but having some flavor and personality goes a long way. His voice actor did Connor no favors as well. I can only remember two ranges of his voice: completely monotone or seething anger. It’s a shame because the antagonists and side characters are particularly excellent. The performances of the Redcoats leaders were outstanding, and dry, sarcastic humor laden with British accents will always make me laugh.That lack of personality and character present in Connor carries its way over to the cities. The two primary towns that you’ll be running around in are mostly lined with rows and rows of similar looking houses with drab, boring rooftops. America’s original 13 colonies aren’t really renowned for their brilliant architecture, so scaling these buildings aren’t as exciting as it was in previous games. One of the most defining aspects for Assassin’s Creed for me personally was the variety of structures that I could climb. The prior Assassin’s Creed games had such settings that you can instantly recognize where you where at any time. Simply put, the cities in Assassin’s Creed III aren’t very thrilling to traverse and they become unmemorable as a result.All in a day's work.Although I’ve only mentioned certain grievances so far, the actual gameplay is fantastic. Ubisoft has perfected the satisfaction of the combat in Assassin’s Creed III and added some deadly new weapons as well. The most apparent addition is the tomahawk that you’ve no doubt seen Connor wield in many previews, but my personal favorite is the rope and dagger. It acts almost like Scorpion’s spear from Mortal Kombat, as you’re able to pull guards in from afar to trip them up, and then finish them off however you please. The new kill animations are particularly brutal, and I would often cringe in delight every time I would witness Connor perform his dastardly deeds.The gameplay is also more difficult this time around, which is something that I wholeheartedly appreciate. Very often in Assassin’s Creed games your armor would get so ridiculously overpowered near the end that dying was almost impossible unless you dropped your controller down and twiddled your thumbs. Furthermore, anytime you were low on health you would be able to pop some medicine and instantly heal yourself up. In Assassin’s Creed III, medicine is gone and there are no health upgrades to be had. Your health will recharge after you finish a battle, and this made the encounters more rigorous and rewarding. The counter system works a little differently too, as it requires a more finesse and skill on the player’s part. All these are welcome alterations that make the murdering of guards more entertaining and gratifying.In addition to the main storyline, there’s bevy of side quests you can partake in. The most notable are the naval missions, which has Connor commandeering a ship throughout the Atlantic. The naval missions are a welcome distraction to the standard gameplay of stabbing faces, as blasting opposing ships to smithereens with cannons is always exciting. There are host of other tasks to do as well: you can liberate Templar infested zones in cities, investigate wild stories that frontiersman are telling, upgrade your Homestead (which is your plot of land that you own), and a whole bunch more. Of course, this is an Assassin’s Creed game, so you’ll have all those feathers to collect if you’re into that sort of thing. Basically, there’s no need to be worried about any kind of shortage of content if you plan on playing Assassin’s Creed III for months on end.Like it's predecessors, Assassin's Creed III has its fair share of historical figures.Assassin’s Creed III is downright a sensational looking game. Everything from the towns all the way to vast frontier you can explore all looks beautiful. Traversing through the wilderness is what really made me appreciate the visuals. All the rivers, trees, and wildlife combine to make a truly cohesive aesthetic. Assassin’s Creed III is also the first game to implement a weather system, and seeing the sprawling outdoors covered in snow was always a pleasant sight. It’s also somewhat kooky fun to be part of actual historical events of the Revolutionary War. I’m not going to spoil anything, but don’t be surprised to be involved in battles that you’ll remember from your fifth grade history class.It’s a shame Assassin’s Creed III stumbles on some of its overarching themes because the core action of it is top-notch. A bland protagonist and some lackluster locales may hinder it some, but the gameplay is first in class. The murderous tools you have at your disposal are all satisfying, and with the challenging new tweaks Ubisoft added, the gameplay becomes more compelling than ever. Throw on top of it in an intriguing story with some deliciously evil villains, and you’ve got yourself a supremely enjoyable game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Back when the original Assassin's Creed came out, it was once lauded yet criticized for being really ambitious yet still not enough things to do. Strange how it turns out to be with Assassin's Creed 3 being really ambitious but give you way more things to do and yet still manage to be just as flawed. Well don't get me wrong, this one is clearly the better game as far as storytelling and more gameplay mechanics to throw at you and yet for all that the game does to entertain and even wow, it still has that franchise problem of feeling like it goes about things the wrong way. There is so much things to do in this it's kind of staggering and yet not everything works and even the things that do work can hit some snags.Continuing the story set forth by the previous 4(!) installments, Desmond Miles finds himself globetrotting to find power sources that will help them get further into a temple and hopefully stop the impending apocalypse that wiped out a prior civilization many centuries past. In order to so he needs to find a key to open the door so in he goes to the Animus where he now lives the memory of one Ratonhnhaké:ton (otherwise known as Connor), a half-British/half-Iroquois man living during the American Revolutionary War. With the British army attempting to secure this new world for themselves and Templars attempting to force their control, Connor must seek aid of the continental army as well as the Assassin training to fight them off.As it has been revealed since the game's release, the game's opening is long, perhaps too long as we learn, in typical Assassin's Creed fashion, each gameplay mechanic piece-by-piece to the point where 5 hours in and I'm still learning how certain things work. While this can make for a deeper storytelling play than perhaps some games receive, the sheer length of it is a tad excessive. Once you get going and Connor dons the suit, the game really does open up and it's here where it can shine as well as frustrate a bit. The story missions tell an interesting tale of revenge and being one man caught in a full blown war but like mentioned before, it takes awhile to get going and Connor himself can seem more like a petulant child than a man conflicted and seeing different views. There's also that irritating system brought over from the previous 2 games where missions aren't fully ""synchronized"" unless you compete certain objectives. These can range from completing it within a certain period, don't get caught or kill a target from the air. For a game offering this much freedom and a ""do things your own way"" to basically be constantly reminded of failing certain objectives and not truly completing a mission is very annoying to say the least.However if there's one thing Assassin's Creed 3 isn't is ""skimpy""; there is a assload of things to do here that anyone that cares about getting bang for your buck or just extracurricular activities will find plenty to do here. You can hunting wildlife with accompanying challenges, you can upgrade your homestead which you can use their services to sell goods to vendors, the variety of missions within the city has been increased and that's a small chunk of it. There's also missions where you get to play captain pirate as you take on enemies at sea on your very own naval ship, complete with cannons and boarding enemy ships. They're exciting and give that right amount of ""set piece"" the main campaign maybe doesn't contain and further upgrading your ship can be a big time and money sink.But then again, all these systems don't really do much to make them feel essential. The hunting missions can be used to gain money which is used to buy upgrades which you use to make money. You're not exactly starved for cash so even without upgrading my homestead, I never felt strapped for cash and buying new weapons isn't entirely necessary since you can do just fine with pistol, hidden blade and tomahawk. Feathers are back in the Skyrim-esque Frontier where you're free to explore and hunt and do non-city missions and you can run after almanac pages on rooftops and even at the end of game they introduce yet another collect-a-thon so to do everything in the game, you'll certainly be busy.Which is where we come down to Desmond's segments, still the most intriguing parts of these games and still the most frustratingly handled. The levels where you travel around the globe looking for the power sources are aggressively linear with barely any UI whatsoever (which presents more of a challenge compared to the glowing ""dodge now"" icons Connor gets to use) and running around a big cave doing platforming stuff can make his segments feel like they're just sorta there: vital to the game's storyline yet play like they're not necessary.Introduced in Brotherhood, the multiplayer in this game can be equal parts exciting yet can cause huge sighs of annoyment as you attempt to kill other players and figure out which one of the many AI characters is actually a player. While the concept and even watching the matches has always been intriguing, playing the different modes ranging from team based objectives like domination or switching between hiding and killing or just straight up free-for-all can also be a divisive experience depending on how often you die. One saving grace though is that it contains a mode called ""Wolfpack"" in which up to 4 players attempt to kill AI and get more points to move onto the next wave and gain more time on the clock which is always counting down. This is a really fun mode yet almost requires teamwork and communication since most of my games resulted in players going for the quick and point-deficient kills rather than the huge bonuses one can acquire.The game's presentation is certainly top notch and while I can't speak to how it compares to the console versions, Assassin's Creed 3 can certainly look gorgeous. From the Frontier segments, both in summer and winter seasons, to the animations of Connor in combat as well as doing his parkour thing, game's really nice to behold. Also, being part-Aboriginal myself, the handling of the Native American themes were well-handled and helped make the game more immersive from a story front.It does have the open world jank though such as one instance where horsing into town, AI would either appear out of thin air or straight up phase through the ground. But textures and framerate for me were solid and barely ran into any crashes or huge glitches. One nasty bug that I'm sure will get fixed is turning up the anti-aliasing causes some huge graphical glitches which I'm sure will get patched.While there is a scope and ambition that makes Assassin's Creed 3 really stand out, the flaws can seemingly rack up and can, like the original, make for a strange experience, albeit a much more realized one. Unlike say games like Dishonored where the flaws were so minimal I felt I'd be almost nitpicking, AC3 is at once the most entertaining, fun, frustrating and disappointing experience all balled up into one.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Over the recent break, I played and completed assassin’s creed 3. Without giving away any spoilers the first 4 sequences were surprising to say the least, and was an incredible step up from the disappointment that was assassin’s creed revelations.The Desmond sequences return and a lot better from the previous parkour training and brief combat sequences. You go through large parkour challenges, stealth sections and surprisingly satisfying combat sequences that are somewhat fully fleshed out levels. Along with some long awaited questions being answered there are a lot more brought up, like how can they make a sequel and is this the end of Desmond. Well for that last question there may be an answer out there, for a long time it has been rumoured that this is Desmond’s last game it is very possible that it is, they do hint as to how they can make sequels but it is all up in the air at the moment.The main story of the game is strong, but some of the sequences seem short as they contain one or two long missions instead of six or seven shorter ones. We meet our new assassin Connor a few hours into the game and ubisoft give you reason to warm up to him straight away as tragedy and misfortune are forced upon him, and like Ezio Auditore, his story is about revenge. The story pans across around 30 years, both before and after the American revolution, and even though we were promised that we would not just be killing redcoats, I think I only got the chance to kill a few, as most of them take no caring to your notoriety level until the epilogue. Throughout the game the story stays strong right up to the end, but I could not help myself from ploughing through all of the assassin recruit missions and homestead missions. I have always been a fan of the meta-games in assassin’s creed and ended up incredibly rich and fully levelled up assassins near half way through the game.Visually, the game is rather beautiful, although there are some buggy glitches. A lot of the time textures would not pop in until you got incredibly close to the object and characters continuously disappeared and reappeared from the screen randomly. Some of the early cut scenes also have very bad texture issues, in one the background had a huge green smudge across the screen, and this happened every time I saw this cut scene. Another issue is horses; even though they are great means of travel they frequently get stuck on rocks and refuse to cross shallow waters.The world is huge, in some cases too huge. The frontier is enormous and there are very few fast travel points. That is the only real issue I have with the frontier though, all of the cities are reasonably sized and full of collectables that are surprisingly rewarding.Overall the game is very fun to play, and it does a good job to keep you interested for the thirty plus hours it has to give you. but it does kind of feel a little lackluster in some parts, still worth playing though]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Incoherent gameplay, bizarre design choices, and frequent bugs squander much of the potential of this visually and thematically stunning game. Disappointment, thy name is Assassin's Creed III.Disappointment is a peculiar emotion. I can be angry without first having felt calm, and I can feel happy without first having felt sad, but to be disappointed, I really need to have experienced something else first, usually ""optimism"". It is this characteristic that makes disappointment the most insidious form of emotional malaise: we are exposed to it entirely of our own volition, by first allowing ourselves to hope.My friends, readers of my blog, and even strangers with whom I've made accidental eye contact know how uncontrollably optimistic I've been about Assassin's Creed III, beginning with the moment I first saw the leaked box art. It was then that I learned the fifth major installment in Ubisoft's epic action-adventure franchise would take place during the American Revolution, that it would feature a bad-ass tomahawk-wielding Native American, and that it would likely allow me the unique opportunity to scamper around the rooftops of a colonial-era replica of my hometown city of Boston, using British Redcoats as foul-mouthed, tea-swilling archery targets.However, the clever reader will have inferred from my earlier ramblings concerning ""disappointment"" that this optimism was... misplaced. So what went wrong? How did Assassin's Creed III make the transition from my Most Anticipated Game of 2012 to Biggest Letdown?Assassin's Creed III is beautiful, but unfortunately looks aren't everything.Let's start with the basics. Assassin's Creed III draws its foundation from the other games in the series, relying heavily on their well-established portfolio of game mechanics. As you step back into the Animus to re-live the adventures of yet another historical Assassin (this time it's Ratonhnhaké:ton, a.k.a. ""Connor"", Desmond's Revolutionary-War-era ancestor), you'll quickly find yourself climbing, sneaking, and murdering again like old times. In fact, you'll feel almost as though you were playing any other Assassin's Creed game... but unfortunately, the key word here is ""almost"". In its attempts to build upon the franchise's winning formula, Assassin's Creed III somehow manages to struggle with narrative and design elements that its predecessors handled with aplomb.Here's an example: in past games, you could boost each mission's completion rating (and take on a bit of extra challenge) through certain ""optional objectives"", such as finishing the mission without being detected, or without taking more than a certain amount of damage. Although this feature reappears in Assassin's Creed III, this time it feels like an afterthought. One mission asked me to perform a certain number of ""corner assassinations"", though I'm quite certain I was never told what those were. Another mission told me I should tackle a man I was chasing from above, but even after about 20 tries, I couldn't convince Connor to heed my commands to do so. Instead, each time he stubbornly leaped onto one of the other guards nearby, to the extent that I really began to believe he was being deliberately and spitefully obtuse.Get used to killing Redcoats, because it's a hell of a lot easier than trying to sneak around without alerting them.This example may seem like garden-variety nitpicking, but Assassin's Creed III is packed with similarly frustrating cases of mechanics that are poorly implemented, totally lacking any sort of narrative context, and occasionally even downright broken. Whereas in past games your primary revenue stream was a sort of real estate side quest that integrated nicely with natural city exploration, now it's a crafting and trading system that takes place through an interface so tedious and clunky that I literally decided to just endure the entire game with a severe cash flow problem rather than suffer through it. Likewise, the revamped Assassin training missions are designed and motivated so badly it almost seems like they're actively trying to discourage you from playing them. And don't even get me started on the lockpicking mini-game, which couldn't have been more awkward if it had involved using a real pair of tweezers to take apart your Xbox Kinect.While all these minor flaws conspire to kill Assassin's Creed III slowly via death by a thousand cuts, there are also some major flaws trying to shiv it directly in the kidneys. One notable failing is the stealth system, which one suspects would be a core game mechanic in a series based entirely around secretly killing people. In past games stealth has been handled pretty competently, but in Assassin's Creed III your adversaries seem to be hyper-aware, and hiding from them has become more difficult than ever. On several occasions I walked slowly and carefully by guards only to have them spring into ""alert"" status without warning, forcing me to run away like a little bitch with half the British army at my heels. (I typically led my pursuers halfway across the city while humming ""Yakety Sax"" to myself, before inevitably giving up on my attempts at evasive maneuvering and simply murdering everyone.) These issues made any part of the game with stealth components extremely frustrating, and any missions where stealth was mandatory downright infuriating.Apparently, Connor's primary role as a player character is to convince us that Desmond's vapid personality is a hereditary trait.At this point, I should probably comment on the plot. Rather than heap more criticisms upon a game that already has endured so many, let's first discuss some narrative aspects of Assassin's Creed III that I don't have a problem with. For instance, I don't have a problem with the bizarre sci-fi turn the series has taken, with its ""ancient precursor civilization"" (à la Mass Effect and Halo), a concept that will certainly go down as the Biggest Game Cliché of 2012. I don't have a problem with Desmond being such a central character, despite the fact that he's about as relatable as a wax statue of Keanu Reeves, and I don't care that Connor is even worse. I don't even have that much a problem with the ending, even though it totally blows.What does bother me though, is that all of these elements were combined in such disarray, resulting in a plot so completely full of holes, that eventually it compelled me not to care why anyone did anything. Why does Connor become an Assassin? Why should I hunt and kill the Templars, and why should I help the American patriots? What is Connor hoping to achieve? The answers to these questions were usually poorly explained, lacking completely, or they happened well after I'd spent hours completing relevant missions with virtually no context. At one point, Connor became angry at another character for executing a captured enemy... as though I hadn't just spent 25 hours murdering every person in a red coat and a funny hat I ran into just for the hell of it. When your protagonist manages to convince you that he's so oblivious that you shouldn't care what happens to him anymore, that's not a good sign.The worst part is, killing Redcoats with a tomahawk really is a ton of fun.If it seems like I'm being too hard on Assassin's Creed III, it's only because it had so much promise, and because at times it even manages to actualize its potential. Visually, the game is absolutely stunning, and the environments have a wonderfully immersive feel, from the lively mercantile docks of colonial Boston, to the burnt-out buildings of New York after the Great Fire, to the tranquil beauty of the New England forests. Moving through these rich historical worlds is especially enjoyable because of the incredible quality of the character animations, as Connor free-climbs cliffs and leaps through treetops with such fluidity and grace it makes the ninjas from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look like a pair of drunken lemurs. Similarly impressive are the naval battle side quests, which are fun to play and do justice to the epic scale of the Revolutionary War setting. Even the fractured plot has its moments; for example, one of my favorite scenes in the game was a death monologue so well-written that it incorporated the word ""tittie"", while still managing to be one of the most profound bits of video-game writing I've encountered.In closing, I've probably been more critical of Assassin's Creed III than it deserves, though in my defense, the game misses a bar that it largely set for itself. With the high quality of previous titles in the series and the immense potential offered by its epic setting, Assassin's Creed III had some big shoes to fill, and it certainly wasn't up to the task. If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game before, then you might not be as disappointed as I was... but if that's truly the case, do yourself a favor and play Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood instead.]]>"

Also, if you are reading this in the future and there have been non-numbered Assassin's Creed games come out; they were probably rush jobs (as Revelations and Brotherhood were). So get this one instead.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Asssassin's Creed is the bravest goddamn game series in a long, long time. You play as a Muslim dude killing knights in the holy land, an Italian dude killing corrupt Catholics (and chilling with people of all cultures in Istanbul), and a conflicted Kanien'kehaka (or something close to that) dude figuring out how to protect himself, his people, and his ideals when all the white mother fuckers just want his land and his killing arm. Desmond goes from a slacker bartender to a creepy killer/ enslaver of the world.Does it have crappy moments? Yeah. Does it waste some potential? Yeah. But what is there is storytelling that deals directly with race, religion, murder, colonialism, sexism and more heady, important issues in often the most mature fashion seen in any media. There's a completely small but great mission where you talk to Miriam, a hard ass hunter lady, about how she won't become a useless, powerless housewife after marriage. It's a great goddamn series purely for this bravery and willingness to confront players about history and what it could mean.None of that would mean shit if the game were bad, but it is not. The stealth is still fun. The naval missions, frontier, homestead creation, and revolutionary war fighting (load those muskets) at times approach real wonder. Desmond's treks into the world are disturbing and difficult without the animus cheats (both of awareness and morality), as they should be.Assassin's Creed 3 is edutainment of the highest order. Even if it didn't manage to look at contradictions in moralism from all sides in its storytelling, its game world tells the story of America better than any book. Here are two cities, still relatively small, still filled with fields and farmers and accents of all sorts. There is no collective America. And, just outside these cities, is wilderness. Animals roam. Trees flourish. On the seas, ships play elaborate and exploding stratego with each other across gorgeous expanses. Early America was conflicted, complicated, an odd mixture of ideals and practicalities, and simply running through the world (even if you don't read the well-written historical accounts that include primary source newspaper writing) reveals the nature of my young country.Game players often lambast boring games or expected games, but when something truly revolutionary in its storytelling and possessing utter respect for the player's intelligence comes around, we look for holes. There are holes. They don't matter. Assassin's Creed 3 is a great game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[My expectations for Assassin’s Creed 3 were very high. A few shorts months ago I was trudging through Assassin’s Creed Revelations; the last entry in the main Assassin’s Creed franchise to deal with Ezio Auditore. Revelations gave an interesting closure to the characters of Ezio and Altair, but the familiarity of the experience wore on me. The promise of a new numbered entry in the series gave me the push I needed to complete it for the sake of story. Assassins’ Creed 3 places the player in the boots of a new ancestor exploring the American Revolution, while also looking to push the plot forward for Desmond and his band of present-day assassins. The result is an uneven experience that takes two missteps for every one thing it gets right.The Animus will pop you into Revolutionary times in a rather jarring way; playing as someone other than the main character. While it’s not a terrible way to introduce the setting and key characters, it goes on far too long. It was difficult to become invested in the game’s open world activities knowing full-well I’d soon be playing as the game’s real protagonist; Connor Kenway. Connor, as the son of a Native-American woman and English man, provides a unique perspective for the player to experience during this tumultuous time-period. This makes for some interesting story beats and conversation as you navigate key moments in North American history. In contrast to Ezio however, Connor is naive, impetuous and stern. While the game appropriately developed this adolescent character, the voice acting is stilted and grating after several hours. Fortunately, the youthful Connor plays like a master assassin.The true joy I had with this game was the combat. Ubisoft makes some minor yet meaningful changes to the way you handle yourself in a fight. Engaging with a crowd no longer feels like they are waiting in line to meet the business end of your blade. Enemies attack while you are occupied with others and countering, disarming and managing their weaknesses is immensely satisfying. Connor battles opponents with brutal precision and the finishing animations are stunning. I often felt like an unstoppable bull, wondering away from my mission objective to gore a group of Red Coats. Highlights include the stealthy use of rope darts and taking a human shield to block a firing line. While the combat throughout feels solid, the open-world mechanics are where the game struggles.Boston, New York and the frontier in-between are meticulously crafted. Tip-toeing through tree-tops, hunting animals and rushing through crowded streets feels appropriate yet unique for the franchise. It`s a shame however the several activities dotting your mini-map throughout the world are so hit-or-miss. Naval battles, a first for the series, put you in control of your own ship and crew. Managing your speed, weapons and course during a battle are made easy with the intuitive control scheme. On the other hand, pit-stops like assassin contracts, courier missions and delivery requests are completely forgettable. Good or bad, all side-missions fail to recognize the crux of entertaining open-world game play; reward. You will find little in the way of enhancing your experience from completing these activities. While it initially seemed interesting, developing your homestead (this game`s analog for city investment) never felt necessary and its interface was a convoluted mess. I`d often find myself rushing back to the story.The story missions themselves are consistently entertaining. The choice of antagonist is smart, impactful and a high-point for the series (I don`t even remember the villain in Revelations). The content of these missions is varied and you`ll encounter some unique set pieces throughout. Conversely, missions involving eavesdropping and stealth are incredibly rigid and are the cause of some frustration. In between trying to thwart the Templar`s influence in the past as Connor, the story is broken up by unobtrusive Desmond missions. I`ve always been bothered by the lack of UI in the real-world, but these assignments are quick and attempt to wrap up franchise spanning story threads in equal pace. The final sequences of Connor`s journey left me satisfied and hopeful for his inevitable future appearances. On the other hand, ``apathetic`` is the best word I can use to describe the conclusion to Desmond`s story.Ultimately, I would recommend fans of the franchise play this game. There is enough of a fresh experience to be salvaged here from underneath the bloat of meaningless side-quests. More focus needs to be placed on quality of content and not quantity. The strength of setting and characters presented in Assassin`s Creed 3 position the franchise for successful sequels.Quick Thoughts:· I played through the entirety of this game after it had been significantly patched.· Synchronizing in trees can be annoying. I`ve jumped to my death several times (not being able to see the ground).· Surprisingly hunting larger animals like bears and wolves with quick-time-events was entertaining.· While they aren’t that rewarding, homestead missions offer fun encounters with a growing cast of quirky characters.· I often struggled with lock picking controls.· The current form of assassin management is dull. I like the idea of each of them having their own abilities, but I rarely used them. Sending assassins on missions every few minutes is tedious.· I played multiplayer for a few hours. It’s as fun as it’s always been and the addition of the Wolf Pack mode is great.Next Up:· X-Com: Enemy Unknown]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[The highly anticipate third instalment in the Assassin's Creed series has been three years in the making and it's the biggest most complete Assassin's Creed yet. Continuing Desmond's story, players are taken from the setting of Renaissance Europe and thrown into Revolutionary America; a change of landscape to say the least.Right from the get go it's clear how much of an improvement visually this sequel is in comparison to it's predecessors; a particular highlight is when roaming across the American Frontier. It's conjures up memories of first playing Red Dead Redemption and being dazzled by the sheer vastness of the landscape. Although it might not be quite as jaw dropping as Rockstar's Wild West, the Frontier in Assassin's Creed 3 is certainly the best of the four free running playgrounds the game has to offer. That's not to say that New York and Boston aren't beautiful in their own right, but there's a certain magic about elegantly whisking through the tree tops, baiting animals and pouncing on unsuspecting poachers which you can't quite get in the urban settings.The combat is another aspect that has been reworked making it more than just a waiting for the counter attack game. Stringing together combos is more intuitive and different tactics need to be adopted for different enemy types. The addition of Conner's Tomahawk makes for some brutal, gritty animations which when coupled with the visceral sound design make for some intense and enjoyable encounters. Free running is another thing that has been honed and perfected even more, making the trees, rock faces, buildings and boats a joy to scale, the animations in particular are beautiful. It's bizarre to think that when the first title came out you'd never have thought they could improve the free running aspect of it.An interesting feature new to the series is naval combat. Initially I went in with the assumption that it'd be a tacked on feature to drive the story. How wrong I was. The gameplay for the naval missions is incredibly addictive. Given command of your own ship complete with crew you are sent on various skirmishes which involve escorting, exploring and destroying. This addition is surprisingly well executed and is a refreshing change of pace from the day to day assassinating.One setback and minor gripe I have, is that Assassin's Creed 3 is slow starting; almost 6-8 hours so. The game begins with a small Prologue before you are given control of Conner which you must control through his younger years before you get trained up as an Assassin. As a result of this, it's a while until you get free reign to explore the world and start to make a dent in the endless amount of side quests and activities available. The positive of this however is that it allows the game to teach you the various new features it has to offer regarding hunting and combat whilst still telling Conner's story; it could just do with shortening the process a little.Sound is a particular area that I feel this game exceeds in, maybe because I'm a little bias and simply adore top sound design and composition, but I feel most would agree that the sound design within Assassin's Creed 3 is top draw, from the visceral, meaty sounds of blades and blunt weapons hitting flesh in combat to the cannon fire in naval combat. I initially thought that with the absence of Jesper Kyd on the soundtrack (who in my opinion has been one of the key reasons for the series' success with his ability to evoke Renaissance Italy through music) that the music wouldn't live up to the quality we've come to expect from the series. Again, how wrong I was. Lorne Balfe is at the helm in the latest instalment and does a truly stellar job of creating a masterpiece of a score, I really think it's one of the highlights of the game.I've always been a huge fan of the series so my final thoughts may be a touch bias. I really think Assassin's Creed is one of the best in the series, perhaps not the best, but certainly up there. It's ambitious open world being the main reason for it's success which is almost limitless in it's activities and hidden areas. The story leaves a little to be desired with another signature cliffhanger suggesting an interesting sequel to come, although that's not to say it's poor, I think it's just become a little predictable in it's format. Saying that, I did enjoy the change of scenery and playing through Conner's story, despite missing Ezio a tiny bit. Overall it's a top game and worthy of the hype it got pre-release and the praise it's received post-release.9/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[If you were like me, you probably loved the crap out of the Assassin's Creed II trilogy. The controls worked well for the most part, and as the games progressed the control scheme was refined and improved. Ubisoft introduced tons of new mechanics and assassination tools. And despite perfect synchronization, there were a lot of ways you could approach a situation. How could Ubisoft mess up a franchise this bad then?Let me begin with this: Assassin's Creed III is not a bad game, however, that doesn't mean that it's a good game either, or a game that lives up to the potential of its predecessors. Also, I haven't really dug into the multiplayer, so consider this a review of the single player.I'd like to start off by talking about that control scheme, the one I said was really great in the Assassin's Creed II trilogy. For some reason, Ubisoft starting shifting the controls all around and wound up making them less precise. For starters, free running and sprinting have no clearly defined toggle. It used to be that you could just hold the high profile trigger and push A and you'd switch from running to free running, allowing for extremely precise control of your speed. They decided that it would be better if they made the game run by making a run a half-depression of the trigger, and a free-run/sprint a full depression. However, this usually just winds up leading to huge issues, especially in chase situations. I often find myself jogging along when I want to be running for my life. This makes free running a huge hassle, one that doesn't feel as fun as it used to be.In addition to this, it seems like your character can have severe issues while trying to climb. Often he will just start climbing in a completely wrong direction, or just get stuck on the wall. This is not useful when bullets are flying through your skull. The climbing worked so well in Assassin's Creed Revelations, what happened? I could ascend a building in seconds, in this game it feels like a chore.Bugs are plentiful in the single player game, and it seems Ubisoft has made no real strides to fix them. I see character models getting stuck in, on, and between objects constantly. There was a mission where you try to approach a house without being detected, and a man was stuck inside of a tree. And if you fired a gun, he'd keep looking for you no matter where you went, so your hiding would be disabled. And because he was in the tree, he's nearly impossible to kill. These are inherent design flaws and bugs, why weren't these addressed? The worst part is that these bugs can be fixed through the magic of digital distribution, yet it has been released for two months now and the most obvious bugs have not even been addressed, and a huge patch just came out too, what are they doing over there in Ubisoft?And then there's the return of perfect synchronization. I know some people view this as adding to the ""content"" or giving ""additional challenge"", but I just view it as restrictive and a method for padding the game. And they made it even more intrusive in this game, because you'll often find yourself with two to four different objectives you MUST complete in order to ""complete the game"". What if I didn't want to sneak up to the house? What if I wanted to just rampage up the road, huh? Oh, so now I MUST defeat 20 enemies? Why can't I focus on the objective at hand, why are you making me sit here and wail on grunt soldiers? This system is inherently flawed and removes freedom from a game that's supposed to be about approaching situations the way you want to approach them.Finally, we have hunting. This seems like a great system... at first. It's very well fleshed out, there's a lot of methods for killing game, it's fun. But then you cannot really do anything with it. Yeah, you can kill some animals, but you can't make any craftables or cook the meat or do anything of the sort. No, you just sell it all away. It feels like lost potential to me. This system could have been thoroughly expanded on, but it just isn't.Despite these major flaws, the game can still be fun when it wants to work. Enemies are more alert and more difficult to take down, making combat more intense and chases longer and more interesting. The combat system has been adjusted, so it's not (as much of) a counter-fest anymore, and it flows really nice. Health was completely redone, but I'm not sure why, I liked the old system. The new system isn't necessarily bad though. Gunplay is slightly expanded, and the game places a lot of emphasis on using firearms to your advantage. The combat and enemy AI, all-in-all, is fairly well improved.In addition, side quests are not nearly as intrusive or annoying anymore. When you activate a sidequest, it becomes more of a passive goal than an active mission. So you could accept a courier mission and then you'd get targets you need to deliver to, but you don't need to feel like you are rushed or anything. You could activate the mission, deliver a letter on the way to a story mission, do the story mission, go back to delivering, take up an assassination contract, and it all makes the game faster paced and less broken-up.The frontier is also a great addition of a map. I was wondering how this game would pull off a revolution-era America, seeing as huge cities are not a common trait of this era and location, but the frontier was handled with an astounding level of finesse. I find running through the treetops exhilarating and fun. The addition of seasons and weather is also a nice touch. A summer frontier can be traversed by foot rather easily, while a winter frontier has deep snow drifts that are difficult to walk through. It's quite an elegant way of doing things.Naval combat in this game is a nice change of pace as well. You have access to two main types of weapons and your own ship that you can customize. It could almost be considered another game in and of itself, and it almost reminds me of ""Sid Meier's Pirates!"" ocean combat.To conclude, I'd like to restate that Assassin's Creed III is not a bad game. However, the issues the game presents often put me in a state where I try to scrape the joy out. They have so many good things in this game, but then the bad often equals or outweighs them because they're so intrusive. I suggest a rental. This is not a game you would want on your shelf, or to revisit any time soon.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Those who are familiar with the Assassin’s Creed franchise know a bit of the complexities that have been fleshed out by developer Ubisoft. Since 2007 we have followed the story of Desmond Miles as he rejoined the mysterious group known as the Assassins in their fight against the Templar. We’ve followed Desmond into the Animus – the machine that uses genetics to grant the user the ability to relive the memories of one of their ancestors – as he trained using the experiences of Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad and Ezio Auditore to learn the ways of a master assassin. And we’ve been enthralled by the developing story arcs that saw Desmond fighting, not only to save the Assassins from the growing power of the Templar, but also to save the world from destruction. Assassin’s Creed 3 – the fifth home console title in the series – follows the same formula as its predecessors. More mysteries involving the First Civilization are fleshed out, Desmond’s small group of Assassin’s are still on the run from the Templar, and Desmond must use the Animus to relive the memories of one of his ancestors to unlock the way forward.Unlike past Assassins Creed titles, Desmond’s story has been drawn out significantly to the point that infiltration and assassination missions are now intertwined into his limited gameplay. Though each Desmond mission acts as a stopgap between Animus missions, Assassin’s Creed 3 really shows the potential of having a future title set in current times, rather than the past.As with past Assassin’s Creed titles, AC3 has two main plot stories; Desmond’s experiences outside the Animus, and the story of one of Desmond’s ancestors. Where AC1 placed players in the shoes of already established assassin, Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad and AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations focused on the memories of Ezio Auditore as he grew from a teenager out for revenge to a tired-out elderly man, AC3 turns to a new ancestor, Connor Kenway. Unlike his ancestors, Connor did not grow up in a family surrounded by Assassins and Templar. This protagonist was raised by his Native-American mother and knew little of his English father. Players are given the opportunity to relive pivotal moments in Connor’s life as he grows from a boy into a young man during the Revolutionary War. Connor’s story for revenge soon becomes entangled with the war between the Patriots and the Redcoats as well as the Assassins and Templar. This places Connor in the middle of some historical moments in American history. Connor’s understanding of the world plays a big role in his sense of justice and right, and he constantly questions the morals of those around him. Instead of backing the founding fathers as our history books always do, AC3 shows some of the consequences of war and the hard choices that had to be made for freedom.Ubisoft has a track record for creating historical settings and does not disappoint in AC3. The setting of AC3 centers on Boston and New York City during Revolutionary War times. These settings allow Connor to be involved in, or even put in motion, some historical events such as the Boston Tea Party and Paul Revere’s Ride. We even see sequences where Connor commands troops in battles such as the Battle of Bunker Hill. Though these sequences do seem coincidental at times, we see the ambition put forth on Ubisoft’s part to try and get players to feel as though the Revolutionary War is upon them. Unfortunately, as some gameplay elements are gained, some elements that have been present in past Assassins Creed games are lost, such as the need to climb buildings and run across rooftops. In past Assassins Creed games, the settings were in cities that were hundreds of years old and had time to develop into massive sights. AC3 takes a different timeframe, long before the massive skyscrapers of the current New York City skyline, in a time where the city was still in development, eliminating the need to race across rooftops and I found myself either running to a destination or riding a horse.Similar to the gameplay introduced in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Boston and New York City feature ways to lessen Templar control and gain Assassin allies. Both cities have liberation contracts in which you assist by performing various tasks that differ from district to district. For example, in the poorer sections of town you will need to burn contaminated blankets or carry the sick to a doctor, while in the farmland you will need to protect farmers as they collect their crops or save civilians from violent Redcoats. After completing all the contracts in a district you have the option to go on a mission and, if successful, recruit a new assassin.Many of the main story missions are assigned at the Davenport Homestead. This location acts as Connor’s home base and has it’s own set of development options. Starting out as only a few structures, the Davenport Homestead can grow over time by completing Homestead Missions. These missions add various non-playable characters to the homestead that produce resources that are used for crafting new items and trading for income.Outside the developing cities of Boston and New York City lies the massive frontier featuring mountain ranges, trees, rivers, and lakes. The scenery here is one of the most detailed I’ve seen in a video game since Red Dead Redemption, but may be one of the most overlooked features in Assassins Creed 3. The ability to fast travel to different areas allows players to completely overlook the frontier portions of the game. The scenery isn’t all the frontier has to offer though, a new hunting mechanic has been added to Assassin’s Creed 3 in which animals in the frontier can be captured and skinned for funds. While some animals, such as deer, raccoons, rabbits, and foxes will run away from you if detected, other animals, such as cougars, bears, and wolves will openly attack you if you get too close. This adds new mechanics to the game and can actually take some time to master. The cleaner the kill, use of one arrow or one stab with your hidden blade, the more the animal skin is worth. This element encourages players to use bait or traps to capture animals, rather than shooting them with a bullet.Speaking of bullets, Assassins Creed 3 adds a few new weapons to the assassin arsenal. First is Connor’s signature weapon, the Tomahawk. After acquiring the Tomahawk after sequence six, Connor uses it as his main weapon and as a way of zipping across ropes like a zip line. The Rope Dart can harpoon enemies while they are on foot or horseback, and can be used to hang enemies from trees. Pistols and Muskets are also new features in the game, each powerful and usually cause a one shot kill. The downsides of using these weapons are the long reload sequence that must be fully completed without interruption in order to shoot the next round, and using these firearms will alert other nearby enemies of your location. Though Muskets act as a bayonet in close combat situations, and act as a way of defending and attacking in close quarters. The Bow and Arrow is by far my choice for long-range attacks as it is quieter and has a shorter reload time. This new edition is also a great weapon to use during hunting.Arguably the greatest editions to Assassins Creed 3 are the Navel Missions. In these missions, Connor captains a ship along the eastern coast of America and battles British Navel fleets for control of the area. Upgrades to the ship’s equipment can be purchased and enhance the durability and power of the vessel. A variety of cannonballs are also made available with their own status effects.Some of the biggest problems with Assassins Creed 3 may lie in the fact that this franchise has been put on a yearly release schedule. We’ve seen the biggest leap in basic gameplay development from Assassins Creed 1 to Assassins Creed 2, which gave players a two-year gap between games. But since the great success of Assassins Creed 2, Ubisoft has opted into releasing a new AC game every year. This has left AC3 marred with basic gameplay that has not changed enough from its’ predecessors and a large amount of glitches that impaired my overall enjoyment of the game. Assassin’s Creed 3 also suffers from a large disconnect between it’s side missions and the main story line. In past AC titles, side missions added to the overall storyline by rewarding players with new weapons, a large sum of money, or some story elements that added to the understanding of the world. In AC3, players can choose to completely ignore the side missions, and will not lose much from the experience. In this respect, the game falls short. The new fast travel mechanics even made it easier to pass up these side missions. Though I was able to get to the next story mission faster, no longer was I stopping along the way to complete a side mission that was marked on my map. The plot points of the main storyline were so interesting that they left me ignoring the side missions in favor of getting to the next story beat. Though some of the side missions can be entertaining, the developers did themselves an injustice by disconnecting them so much from the main storyline.Though I did enjoy the majority of my experience with Assassin’s Creed 3, I can’t help but feel a bit burned out from the yearly release schedule. The franchise has come a long way, but is not adding enough gameplay innovations to completely justify a yearly release cycle. Though Desmond’s story has seen some resolution in this latest release, Ubisoft has left enough room to continue the franchise and has already planned another release for quarter 4 2013. Will the next Assassin’s Creed impress enough players to convenience them to come back again? We can only wait and see.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Pros:-Great graphics and setting-Huge open world to explore-Good attention to detail-Interesting storyline and characters-Naval combat is epic-Game runs at a constant high frame rate-Parkour elements are much improved-Cities offer plenty to doCons:-Combat is still too easy-A bit buggy-Lack of side missions in Frontier is disappointingAssassin's Creed 3 is an ambitious sequel, and while it may make not fulfill all it's promises, it's still a good step forward for the series.Assassin's Creed 3 puts you in the role of Connor, a Native American who get's caught up in the American Revolution. Throughout your journey you will meet historical figures such as George Washington, Daniel Boone, Benjamin Franklin, and more! Your course of actions will dictate the future of America and help to ensure it's independence, without spoiling anything, the storyline is quite engaging with twists and turns, Assassin's Creed 3 will keep your focus throughout.Interacting with historical figures is one of Assassin's Creed 3's finest experiencesIn fact Assassin's Creed 3 does an excellent job with it's atmosphere and setting, walking down the streets of colonial New York and Boston is a sight to see, with crowds of people moving and shouting, with street fights breaking out between the Patriots and Royal Army, the world of Assassin's Creed 3 feels alive!The missions also have a good amount of variety, you will engage in all out combat, stalk enemies from far away, command a naval vessel, and more. However not all aspects of Assassin's Creed 3 are improved, for example the combat is even more easy than before. Instead of having other options such as grabs and dodge etc...., you now only have two, counter and guard break. Countering is made even easier thanks to the game slowing down the attack, allowing you to easily counter attack, and guard break does an attack that simply breaks the enemies defense.There are a few other aspects such as being able to throw enemies in a counter instead of killing them, or using enemies as human shields to block musket fire, but for the most part combat feels even more toned down than before. It is flashy, very flashy and brutal, it's quite impressive to watch, but in terms of depth the combat in Assassin's Creed 3 is lacking.Another problem with Assassin's Creed 3 is the lack of side missions in the Frontier section of the game. The world map is huge, it's simply jaw dropping as to how vast it is, but Assassin's Creed 3 offers little things to do in it's Frontier aspect. Aside from the occasional raid on passing British Cavalry, you will find little to do.It makes the Frontier feel like a big pool in terms of size but shallow in it's depth, which is a shame as you will often come across small towns and villages but they feel more like simple scenery than anything worthwhile. Fortunately the cities offer plenty of side missions that make up for this, from starting riots to finding lost almanac pages, burning blankets with small pox, and more. New York and Boston are the place to go for side missions. There are also a variety of gambling missions available for you to engage in if you so choose.Hunting is an important gameplay feature in Assassin's Creed 3Assassin's Creed 3 is also a bit buggy, ranging from characters simply not opening their mouths during cut scenes to getting stuck inside objects, or just NPC's flat out disappearing, Assassin's Creed 3 is has it's fair share of bugs. For the most part these are not serious issues, but on occasion you will get a bug that will make you restart the checkpoint. Hopefully Ubisoft fixes these issues soon.From a visual standpoint Assassin's Creed 3 is gorgeous, you can definitely see the new engine in effect with it's graphical prowess . Character models are very detailed, they show emotion in their faces. The world changes with the seasons and it's beautiful to see the nice sea of green in the spring and summer, and it later transition to a winter wonderland. The game also runs in a constant high frame rate, even in the midst of heavy combat or tons of of NPC's, this makes Assassin's Creed 3 even more impressive. Parkour elements are also improved in Assassin's Creed 3, you can easily move, climb, and run to your destination, even complex things such as moving through trees is made easy.Assassin's Creed 3 also features naval battles, these are quite engaging and fun. Taking charge of a crew, you shout out various commands such as the Full Sail or Half Sail, and when to fire and what kind of ammo to use. You can also get up close and board enemy ships and engage in pirate like battles. The naval battles are one of the best aspects of Assassin's Creed 3. There is also multiplayer, however I have not yet played this so cannot comment, but I will talk about it once I do.Final Verdict:While Assassin's Creed 3 misses a few marks, it's still a great game and it features a lot to be appreciated. If you're a fan of the series you owe it to yourself to play Assassin's Creed 3.Assassin's Creed 3 get's a 4/5]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed is a franchise that I have not got on well with. In fact, it is more to do with me not fully giving the games a chance. My first experience with the series was with Assassin’s Creed, which came out in 2007. I was fairly hyped for the game, mainly due to the free running aspect, where you could climb pretty much anything you wanted to in the game. I got to the 9or 10 assassination and just gave up. I did not get on with the tedious and simple combat and I got seriously bored playing the same six events over and over again, since only the assassinations ever added different gameplay mechanics to the mix.Along came Assassin’s Creed II. Again, the hype for the game was huge and people were saying the problems with repetitiveness were gone. I decided to skip the title as I still had that sour taste from the first game. Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood came out in 2010, and some were saying this was the best game in the series yet. I decided to give it another shot, but the game just did not click with me after the initial three to four hours. I was told to keep going, but I opted out to play something else I knew I would enjoy. After playing Assassin’s Creed III, I kind of wish I did stick with the series.If you are like me and don’t fully know what has happened in the story arc, then Assassin’s Creed III does a quick job to bring people up to speed with the plot. It is not deep, but it gives you enough idea to enjoy the story that follows, and with a new character and setting, it makes for a good place to step into if you haven’t yet experienced the series. This instalment follows the tale of Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor as he becomes known as, a native American who is trained as an Assassin to get rid of the Colonial Templers and defend his tribe. Desmond is once again the hero in the present time, who is using the animus to jump into memories of his ancestor, and while I don’t want to go over the story too much since a lot of the surprise is seeing what unfolds, I will say that it takes around five hours before you even meet Connor. Interpret that as you wish.That is one of the slight problems with Assassin’s Creed III: it just takes too long to get going. I liked the idea behind the introduction and what goes on before you meet Connor, but I do wish there was more included in this part rather than having a cutscene, going someplace, doing a little fighting, and repeating, before the game opens up.The setting for Assassin’s Creed III takes place between 1753 and 1783, and includes the American Revolution, an era which has hardly been touched upon in videogames, making it a special setting to experience. Connor will travel across a huge open landscape named the Frontier, while also visiting the cities of Boston and New York and meeting famous historic people, such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Connor will also take part in memorable battles and key points in the American Revolution timeline – for example, commanding armies to fight in the Battle of Bunker Hill or destroying creates of tea in the iconic Boston Tea Party protest. As with past titles, Assassin’s Creed III does well with the history it is portraying, with locations crafted with delicate details to bring them alive, while the use of believable, real-life characters gives a sense that you are in the 18 century.Assassin’s Creed III‘s world is huge. Truth be told, it is big enough to give some other open-world games a run for their money. This is not limited to what you can explore but what you can also do. There is a varied amount of gameplay mechanics, both new and returning, that are woven into the core of Assassin’s Creed III: some brilliant, some okay and some irritating. One of the new gameplay features that was heavily advertised by Ubisoft are the naval battles, and I found these to be often tense and highly enjoyable.When taking part in the naval battles, Connor is put in control of the Aquila, his own personal warship, and must control his crew by giving orders to attack and adjust the sails to change speed of the ship. The wind is also a variable (represented on a radar by a big triangle marker) that needs to be taken into account. A powerful blow can stop your ship or even blow it off course – not good when you are in the heat of battle and boats are launching cannonballs at the Aquila. While the gameplay is simple and the boat controls are easy to understand, it somehow manages to be engaging, and when you are in a battle with the odds stacked against you, it gets rather exciting. A note about naval warfare is that it is mostly optional. There are around three or four points in the game where you are forced to take these missions on, but the rest are side-quests that you can do in your own time, so if you personally do not like naval combat, then you won’t have to do them much.Going through the main story took me around 14 hours. It will vary depending if you decide to take part in the hundreds of side-quests that are littered around the map. During the story, you will be doing the series’ trademarked free running, which has been slightly tuned to give the player an option to stop Connor from jumping or falling if it will harm him. If you want to disable the safety aspect, then you need to hold down X along with R1, which will allow Connor to jump no matter how dangerous the drop is. Trees can now be traversed on as well, but are more restricted in movement compared to climbing the houses and landmarks of Boston/New York. A starting point needs to be found on one of the lower branched trees; from there you can normally travel a good distance until they are spaced too far apart to continue. I found that I used trees mostly for attacking unsuspecting enemies or animals rather than to travel faster across land. It could also be due to the fact that fast travel is in the game, as this gets you across the land much faster.Combat is another thing you will do often. I feel that Assassin’s Creed III has a gameplay style similar to Batman: Arkham City, turning more into an action game with sneak mechanics rather than being a true stealth game. There aren’t many assassinations that take part in Assassin’s Creed III, and a few of them are story-driven rather than being solely reliant on the player to sneak in, stab someone and get the hell out without being detected. A lot of side-quests and challenges have you battling in the open, surrounded by enemies. It’s only the 100% Synchronisation tasks that require you to be a master assassin – some are ridiculously challenging but thankfully it only unlocks a piece of clothing.As you know, I had a problem with the combat in the first title, but in Assassin’s Creed III I grew to understand its improved mechanics and pacing. It can be still a bit too reliant on countering while enemies don’t wait as often to strike at you, sometimes being attacked by two or three at a time that can counter back at you and block/parry your random combos when lashing out with the tomahawk. Being able to equip two weapons at a time – something new to this game – allows you to blend combos between the two. You could be hacking at someone and, due to the lack of lock-on in this game, turn around and at point-blank range, shoot the person behind you in the head with the pistol. Guns are powerful but extremely slow to reload (around 6-8 seconds), since this is a time period where you had to pour your own gunpowder into the barrel after every shot. The combat is exciting when messing with the tools at your disposal. A favourite of mine is the rope dart, an item that I like to call the Scorpion move, as you launch it at your opponent and pull, simulating a “get over here” move made famous by the Mortal Kombat character.Some gameplay segments of the story fall short on the rest of the game’s quality. I despised the chase sequences, especially the one that takes place after arriving at New York, which lasts forever – yes I mean forever, since he travels the same course throughout the city until you stop him. It must have taken me around ten attempts to get him. What makes it annoying is that you have to dodge past people that get in your way, seriously slowing you down if you touch them, and make sure you don’t accidentally run up an object when you are holding down the run button. He moves at the same speed as you do, so the only chance you get to stop him is by trial and error – learning his path and taking a shortcut to get in front of him. It’s just not fun and is damn annoying.The interface can be messy. This is mainly the area where you select weapons, while there are four shortkeys with the D-Pad to pick tools/weapons on the fly, when you want to change these, or access an item that you don’t use as much; the game requires the player to hold down R2, which pauses the game as it brings up this other menu. It would have been better to implement it on the fly somehow, rather than stopping the flow of the game when in combat or escaping from the enemy.Optional is the key word for most of the content that is available in the game. The big open world of Assassin’s Creed III is home to a variety of side-quests. Some follow their own small stories, such as finding out about a mysterious sea creature or the Sasquatch, while others require you to hunt down animals and trade their skins in for money. Connor has a base in the Frontier, and if you rescue any of the potential recruits stranded around then they will come join your home. There are metagames here that can be completely avoided. You don’t have to go gain more assassins to follow you, but you will miss out on the help they offer in a fight, something similar to Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood I believe. There is just so much to do that the optional stuff makes up around 70% of the game, giving people plenty to do once the curtains are closed on the main story.Assassin’s Creed III on the PS3 looks fantastic. The environmental scope, with snowy fields and a weather system that brings rainstorms, all look great. Some textures can be a bit bland, but it’s pushing so much at once that you kind of forgive it. It is a shame that it is plagued with some framerate problems that crop up in busy city locations or in combat when surrounded by a lot of enemies. It can hinder the countering in some cases, but more often than not, the slowdown does not affect the game to the point where it makes it unpleasant. Pop-in and draw distance is shorter than I would have liked it to be, but this is no doubt to keep the framerate within a good enough range. These are signs that the current consoles are beginning to struggle under the technological pushes that companies are striving for with a new set of consoles. This should not be a problem in the upcoming PC release. Bugs are often present and spoil the overall presentation, with people getting stuck behind objects and items floating in the air, but the worst comes during cutscenes, as you will see Connor straight up walk through some guys like he is auditioning for a scene in Patrick Swayze’s famous film, Ghost.Multiplayer makes a return, along with a new mode called “Wolf Pack” that puts four people in a team and must cooperatively assassinate as many targets in the allotted amount of time. The other modes play out similar to the other Assassin’s Creed games, where you are given a target to find in the midst of similar-looking NPCs that fill a small area, while someone is doing the same to you. It is fun, but does become stale after a while. Domination is the same idea but throws in parts of the map that need taking over and holding to win. A level-up system is in place, so you can customise your character and equip perks to give yourself the upper hand in a match. The developers have also implemented a small story into the multiplayer, just to give you a reason to play it.Assassin’s Creed III is an ambitious monster of a game and it is no wonder it was worked on by multiple teams for nearly three years. It’s a sequel that expands on past games and brings in an untapped, refreshing historical setting and packs it with so much to do that you’ll be busy way after finishing the interesting and distinctive story. Assassin’s Creed III is a great game, spoilt only by the over-long introduction, some bad mini-game sections in the story, bugs and inconsistencies with the optional side content; but that’s what those are: optional. Looking at Assassin’s Creed III as a whole, this is a game worthy of your time, engaging on so many levels and a joy to experience. It might be debatable if it is your favourite game in the series, but for me, it has reawakened my interest in the franchise and turned me into a fan.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[My playing of Assassin's Creed III mirrored the range of emotions I've experienced through the last few games in the series, though with higher highs and lower lows than what I experienced last year with Revelations. There's still fun to be had here, especially if you've enjoyed a nice long break since playing the series, but there is so much glut and messiness that it's easy to think this series' best days are truly behind it.It's Still FunAt its core, Assassin's Creed III is still fun because being an assassin is still fun. Free-running, hatchet-fighting and assassinating is enjoyable, and I dare say it's relaxing and cathartic in its flow. (Jeez, what does that say about me?) These core mechanics also feel improved from the previous games, with an improved fluidity to the combat and (slightly) less instances of the character doing something unwanted and crazy while free-running.New Setting. Finally.My favorite thing about this latest game is the long overdue change in setting. The world and sense of place the game creates is impressive, whether you be in a London opera house, Revolutionary-era Boston or in the Caribbean doing battle at sea. The game is also frequently gorgeous, which makes the abundance graphical glitches and hiccups all the more painful.Busy Work? I'll PassThis game is littered overcrowded disgustingly obese with side missions, side quests, side hunting, side trading, side chatting, etc. etc. It's all way too much, and I barely touched any of it. The few attempts I made to dig in either overwhelmed me (trading system) or seemed completely pointless (fighting for Templar territory, treasure hunting). Even monetary awards seemed futile, as I was easily able to hack my way through any enemy in the game with the default (and awesome) hatchet. This is the first Assassin's Creed I didn't even bother to reach all viewpoints, because who gives a shit? The one thing that did intrigue me was being able to build up your homestead, but the first side mission I attempted in this vein bugged out on me, leaving me unable to complete it. That made my decision to abandon those ambitions that much easier.The ""Who Cares?"" StoryThis is nothing new to this series, but I could not have cared less about Connor and, eventually, Desmond's story. I was admittedly excited and intrigued by the opening of the game and the potential to see Connor develop while witnessing his sure-to-be silly role in America's Revolutionary War, but it quickly faded into dumb missions, unclear motivations and generic character work. This leads to a few moments near the end of the game that should have had substantial emotional impact but instead fell completely flat. And honestly, I don't even know what to say about Desmond's story. I don't understand most of it, and where it leaves Desmond and his team of people (whose names I can't remember) is incredibly weak.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[ The Assassin’s Creed series is among the darlings of this generation of games for me, with the first title in the series breaking completely new ground and really bringing a feeling of “freshness” way back in 2007. AC 2 and Brotherhood have undoubtedly been the high point of the series, but with the announcement of Assassin’s Creed 3 Ubisoft looked set to stem the feeling of annualised stagnation with the biggest entry yet. A new setting and protagonist, new gameplay mechanics and a break with the Ezio storyline looked set to completely reinvigorate a series that already had a shocking amount of lore under its belt, and Ubisoft looked ready to fulfill the potential of one of the most ambitious and exciting trilogies in recent times.This crowed are back again, and you may not like the answers they findThe story of Assassin’s Creed 3 follows directly on from the ending of Revelations, and if you have not played all the games in the console series then you will certainly be missing story beats, despite the effort 3 makes to fill players in on what has happened up till this point. Desmond and the modern day assassin’s are still on the run from Abstergo and locked in a race to save humanity from a deadly apocalypse, using the animus to find the locations of the treasures they need to access the ancient vault. To do this Desmond taps into the memories and experiences of a new ancestor: Connor. A native American and son of an English nobleman, Connor certainly had the makings of one of the most compelling protagonists in the series, but unfortunately this is not the case. Connor is a dry and relatively uninteresting character, lacking the sheer charisma of Ezio or even the doctrinal devotion of Altair, and as a result he just falls flat. He has one emotionally impactful scene in the entire game, but beyond this I felt little attachment to the motives or plight of Connor as a character, and as he is the lead role for the game this is a serious problem in a series that had 3 games driven to success by the strength of Ezio as a lead role. The game also puts players in the role of Haytham Kenway, a predecessor of Connor and a far better character, but we only control him for the opening chapters of the game.Outside of the animus Desmond is as plain and uninteresting as ever, with that story floundering ever since it failed to make good on the demise of Lucy. Answers are finally provided regarding much of the mythos of the series but frankly I found them all unsatisfying and the ending of Desmond's story in particular to be grievously insulting. Many people were in uproar at the Mass Effect 3 ending, but I feel that the conclusion to Assassin’s Creed 3 is far worse as it not only leaves players without any kind of satisfying ending to their interaction with this series but it also fails to draw the events that have taken place up to this point to a conclusion. It is pathetic and poorly placed, feeling extremely abrupt and pretty much exemplifies the lack of harmony between the modern setting story and the historical drama that has wracked the series since Brotherhood. It feels as that the relationships that the characters rely upon to develop are never fleshed out, and interactions never hit the notes they are clearly meant to as a result. Connor and his mentor Achilles get a lot of attention, but I never got a sense of a significant connection between them in contrast to Ezio and Mario. There are just so many missed opportunities for a better story throughout the narrative that it is painful to watch at times.The snow covered colonial environments are gorgeous from a rooftop viewThe visuals of the game are strong at a glance, with great scenery, a faithfulness to the setting and a crisp appearance to everything in typical Ubisoft style. Animations for characters are still among the best in gaming, and the colonial setting is fantastically mixed between urban areas and a wild frontier that reminded me of Red Dead Redemption. The seasonal changes bring snow to rural settings in a beautiful way, and the water of the game is stunning, which is fitting for the visual highlight that is the naval battles.However, there are a host of small yet niggling graphical glitches that interfere with the beauty of the whole thing. Janky animation locks interrupt the near flawless on foot characters for the first time in my experience of this series, the horses are especially affected by this as they often get stuck on terrain in the environment, and pop-in is rife. Lip synching is also all over the place, which is very disappointing for a game of this calibre and profile. Finally, the colonial America setting is inherently less interesting or impressive than Renaissance Italy and Constantinople. Wooden buildings and manors are lovely, but they pale in comparison to the edifices, castles and cathedrals of past Assassin’s Creed games, and though this is an inherent part of the setting I still found it disappointing.As for the audio, the voice acting is generally fine. Connor is uninspiring but Haytham and Charles Lee are fantastic, and the supporting cast all do their jobs admirably. Unfortunately the music is lacking in Assassin’s Creed 3, and the absence of Jesper Kyd has left a gaping wound in my view. The soundtrack is serious and grim constantly in Assassin’s Creed 3, completely lacking the exciting, haunting and often chilling work of Kyd. To put it simply, the soundtrack of Assassin’s Creed 3 is just background noise while the work of Kyd in the previous Assassin’s Creed games was nothing short of iconic, and Assassin’s Creed 3 doesn’t even approach its brilliance. This was a huge letdown for me personally as the music is a huge part of this series for me.Things run smoothly, when they work right....The game plays the same as Assassin’s Creed has always played, with the same combat fundamentals, use of projectiles and mix of stealth with straight out combat. Some of the additional stuff from Revelations has been eliminated, but I have to say that I did not enjoy actually playing most of the sections that Assassin’s Creed 3 throws the players way for a number of reasons. Firstly, the combat has been so overshadowed by the likes of Arkham Asylum and City at this point that I find it unbelievable that Ubisoft are content to leave it in its current state. Its stodgy, lacks weight and just doesn’t work all that well with its lack of tactical depth and plainness. Kill-cam animations are added for flash, but combat is still too hectic and lacks the enjoyment that I get out of games that are just better for their combat.The free running and exploration is also falling behind, with its plethora of control issues and frustrating busywork. Infamous, Sleeping Dogs, Arkham and other games have all surpassed Assassin’s Creed when it comes to making it fun to run and jump over things, and something needs to be done about this badly. Similarly, the series has always alluded to have stealth elements, but Assassin’s Creed 3 easily has the worst stealth segments of all the AC games. Its broken thanks to the strict mission parameters that result in instant desynchronised if failed in any way. Bad camera angles, unclear enemy line of sight and poor controls all contribute to this, but in my view a game that is incapable of implementing decent stealth should not force stealth missions onto the players.AC3 has far too many linear and scripted segments, including a painfully long 6-8 hour tutorial before the game really gets going. The early missions are boring and the pacing is a mess, and without spoiling anything the chase sequence towards the end of the game is a perfect example of what not to do in a game. All that said, the naval battles are spectacular with great controls, and exhilarating sense of power and excitement, and overall are by far the best addition to the gameplay in AC3.The multiplayer is back and seems to be more refined and fun than ever before, with a lot of value to be gotten from it. However, I have never been interested in the multiplayer segments of AC, and so I have not played much of it and can’t really comment too much on its overall quality.Connor contemplates the many bad design decisions made in his gameDesign wise Assassin’s Creed 3 has numerous problems, but they all boil down to one clear source: the game does too much. It feels like 3 games in one: The prologue, the rise of Connor and the modern day setting. There are simply too many mechanics running alongside each other and making the game a lumbering mess. The interface is sluggish and poorly designed, with a horrific weapon selection system and a pathetic mini-map. The fast travel system is a welcome addition but is implemented inconsistently, and the way items are selected is just bizarre.There are also a lot of technical problems besides the ones I mentioned already. Loading screens are rampant, with abrupt transitions from the end of a fight to a cutscene, music cutting out and long pauses in the middle of dialogue. The game also does not look all that good in motion, with some poor lighting and artificing effects that are plain shoddy for a top level game. There are also scripted sequences like chases and infiltration missions that keep players on far too tight a leash, desynchronising them if they take a single wrong step. It goes against intuitive gameplay and is my single biggest gripe with the AC series at this point. There is a huge amount of side activity to do, but none of it is fun or interesting and as a result I avoided it as much as possible.Finally, it feels to me that nothing in Assassin’s Creed 3 works all that well. Running is laggy, climbing obstacles clunky, fighting is hectic, shooting takes too long and lacks impact, targeting your movements while scaling trees/buildings is a disaster, the list goes on. It really feels like the game lacks a single core mechanic that it does well, and this is a serious issue what resulted in a lack of engagement for me personally.Naval warfare is absolutely magnificentAssassin’s Creed 3 is jaw dropping in its scope, but it tries to do too much at once, and as a result manages to do nothing to the extent that it deserved. The fundamental “assassinations” are still great, and I love the short conversations that Connor has with each of his targets after mortally wounding them, and the naval battles are nothing short of truly fantastic. The design flaws with Assassin’s Creed are the real problem here, and they are more apparent because of the sheer amount of things that AC 3 tries to do and the lack of cohesion between them. There is a lot of unnecessary clunk that gives me the feeling that the series is floundering with a lack of vision. The narrative of the game is also deeply disappointing overall. Though still worth experiencing for followers of the series to see the conclusion. Assassin’s Creed 3 could, and should, have been a powerhouse gaming experience, but because of a lack of direction it is merely a decent game. It has a huge amount of content, but I think that Ubisoft should think about the creative direction of the series and refine the mechanics before farting out another annualised release to further diminish what I considered a gold standard brand. It worries be that before I even managed to finish the singleplayer campaign after getting the game at Christmas the next game, Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag had already been announced. In conclusion, Assassin’s Creed 3 is good but its potential is spoiled with poor design and weak story elements. Pros:Loads of content and varietyStrong sense of style and attention to historical detailsSea battles are nothing short of stunningCons:Bugs, glitches and inconsistend designWeak music compared to the rest of the seriesUnsatisfying story with an awful endingWtf:Actually managed to balance the British-American viewpoints in a Revolutionary War settingScore:5/10 - Average]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I came into Assassins Creed 3 knowing I wasn't a big fan of the first few games. They weren't horrible, but the good parts simply weren't enough to outweigh the annoyances or differences in taste. With AC3 I knew the setting was completely different as well as the characters, enemies and story. That alone was enough for me to give it a shot and I'm glad I did as AC3 while still having some tedious bits also has some amazing ones that are well worth experiencing. The gameplay over all is stunning, still it is brought down by a few annoyances which do stand out from time to time but the pros easily outweigh the cons. The only positive thing about many of the tedious parts is that they do a good job of making the bulk of it optional. I could not have gotten through the game if not for fast traveling and skipping 99% of the side quests or activities. That said a story driven play through will still take you over 10 hours easy. Character movements and kill animations are nothing short of amazing. There are still some occasions where you will easily make missteps but they are few enough to not leave a permanent mark on the game. Not only is the typical AC gameplay great with its smooth combat and stealth kills but they've added some new moves and surprise! Open sea battles with ships, sails, crews and cannons. The ship battles alone are a fantastic addition to this game, solid enough to warrant a game of its own. The detail of the ships is impressive and really makes you feel like you are engaged in the action without becoming too overwhelming. There are a few too many chase sequences, loading screens, and the game could have used a couple hours less filler but it is still well worth getting through Connors story line. Last and probably least it is worth noting that Desmond and the Animus is still a confusing and boring hurdle to get over to access more of what you really want.I enjoyed the story, quite a bit to be honest, well the early America story that is. This is the first Assassins Creed title where the characters, setting and time period have actually interested me. On top of that the Ubisoft team did a great job of loosely sticking to historical story beats and making clever and thoughtful characters that weave the Creed and Templars into American history. They have also done a great job of not plastering everything black and white. There are some clear grey areas for Connor and the player and it makes for a great experience that can be rare in games. The list of characters you grow to have emotions for is fairly long and that in a video game is a great achievement. Connor himself is also quite interesting. A man that is thrown into an unfamiliar situation with an understandable naivety. He struggles to figure out what he thinks is right while battling between differing perspectives as reality isn't always black and white.The engine under the hood is a great achievement for this gen except for a couple issues. One being bugs, I played this game 6 or 7 months after release and still ran into a couple bugs. Now the largest issue here is the mapping. The game is supposed to be open world. Having to run from point A to B especially on a horse who handles rough terrain like a 1 legged centipede with a map that shows no topography and landscapes with countless cliffs is a huge pain in the ass. What should have been a engrossing world becomes frustrating with road blocks constantly slowing you down. The fast travel system was nice but also didn't function nearly as smoothly as it should.Assassins Creed 3 is an amazing game that has a few problems to weigh it down just enough to not love it. If the Animus stuff was gone, if the bugs weren't there, if it were tightened up a bit to avoid filler and if the open world wasn't so tedious a game with this kind of potential could have easily been a GOTY winner. With some updates and price drops if you haven't played this yet go pick it up!]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[It's time to hop back in the Animus with Desmond and friends in the newest installment of the Assassin's Creed series, Assassin's Creed III. The game is a mixed bag. It includes some things you'd expect, some things you wouldn't expect, and some things you don't want to endure.Taking place around the time of the American Revolution the player takes control of a new character, Connor, a Native American who's out to avenge the death of his friends and family all while aiding the Americans to fight off the British. Connor might even uncover a Templar conspiracy along the way too.The story is well-constructed and one of the better, if not the best, stories in the series. Without giving anything away you will see some twists that have never been seen in an Assassin's Creed game. I also welcome the change from religion to politics because quite frankly the religious aspect was wearing a little thin. This game has some of the most memorable characters in the series. Up until this point you probably couldn't name anyone other than Ezio or Altair. But not all is perfect in Colonial America. As superb the story is the game is highly inconsistent in other areas.The tried and true gameplay you've come to know and love has been tweaked. For the most part the changes make playing the game frustrating. The controls are simplified now in numerous ways. The biggest change is in the free-running system. In previous games you needed to hold the right trigger to run and hold the A button to climb, jump, swing etc. In the new game you just need to hold the right trigger. I don't know why they made this change but I found it to be a hindrance more than anything. There are many occasions where my character jumped to something I didn't want him to just because there is only one button to climb. Sometimes if you're sprinting after a target you might mistakenly climb up a wall instead of running down the street. I can't say that this has happened to me in any of the other games. This is a new problem starting with this game.Gone are the buttons for gentle push and horse whistle from past games. In order to to use your horse whistle you have to equip it to a slot, something that is so bothersome I didn't care enough to do it at all. A strange change because you can do another sort of contextual whistle to distract guards without having to change your weapon slot. Which brings up another issue equipping something is done though a big cumbersome menu. This wouldn't be a problem but all of the menus in this game are laggy. They are too complicated and pretty for their own good.They also changed the targeting system from prior games. Before you could lock on to anyone you want. In this game it does targets for you which again can lead to unwanted targeting just like the free running lead to unwanted climbing. Now the left trigger is mostly useless. It has a “precision” targeting reticule but it's not like if you fire your weapon it hits where you're targeting it just means you want to aim at a certain target. It also awkwardly shifts the view so you can't really play from this angle. It is just a really cumbersome system. It is also worth noting that an aerial assassination is no longer silent, I don't know if this was intentional or not but it is something you will have to live with.There are a lot of gameplay changes but the game doesn't really tell you how to go about using these changes. One of the biggest changes is the item crafting and trading. In the game you have a homestead, this is similar to the bases in the other games you upgraded that would make you money. In this game to make money you have to buy resources from your farm and craft them into other resources to trade throughout the land. It's really not the most intuitive system and you're on your own to figure it out for the most part. Other quick notes I can add is now you can hunt animals (this also factors into the trading and crafting part I mentioned earlier). Previous faction missions similar to the earlier games are different too. They don't have a story element anymore. There are assassination contracts, these used to have a story and a purpose. In this game you just go to a guy and then kill targets. A disappointing change or maybe they didn't have time to flesh it out.One of the best changes in the game are the naval missions. The developers nailed this. You sail the ocean on the Aquila, your ship, and go on missions and battle ships. It's all quite thrilling and is really the spark this series needed. Other than the multiplayer the most fun was had on these naval missions. Speaking of the multiplayer it has returned yet again. It's pretty much the same but with new balancing issues, the hunted now knows when the assassin is around him. There is also a new wolfpack mode which is just like a timed co-op game vs the computer. Not a bad mode but could use some work, hunting human players is much more fun.The game is a mixed bag graphically. The multiplayer looks and runs great but when it comes to the single player there are some rough edges. You can tell the system is being pushed to the limit because it sort of looks good but nowhere as near good as preceding games. Pop up is abundant. People will pop in and out of view five feet in front of you. In fact I once rode straight ahead, stopped and a tree drew in right above me. The game has some graphical issues that I've never seen in a game before. Impressive but not in a way you want to impress someone.There are some objects that should have physics such as hanging store signs which will stop you in your tracks like a brick wall. The same can be said for clotheslines. If on foot you can step under the clothes and they will act as if you had walked past some clothes hanging on a line. If you are on a horse or carrying a body the clothes will act like a solid object and you'll have to go around. There is one positive to note about the graphics and that is now that the seasons change. If you've ever wanted to run around in the snow in an Assassin's Creed game now is your chance.The game has a good amount of bugs as well. I've seen characters stuck on a rock running in place. I've killed enemies in the game and they still show up on the radar as alive. Sometimes you can't pick up a body unless you loot the body first. Amongst a group of guards I've strangled a guard while I was unarmed. The rest didn't react and let me choke all of them out one by one. The list goes on. In fact I seemed to encounter an issue that only affects people with the original big Xbox (before the slims) rampant freezing issues. I couldn't get much help on the issue, this probably won't affect you but for me it did and it was very frustrating.But that is Assassin's Creed 3 in a nutshell. A frustrating game. It's buggy, a graphical mess but there are some bright spots. The story is great. You should keep up with the series just based on that. The naval missions are an excellent addition and the multiplayer is still fun. Assassin's Creed 3 is worth playing, I just hope they can work the kinks out before the next game.

Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I've been on an Assassin's Creed tear since Black Flag arrived at my doorstep for the Playstation 4. While being wholly aware that the previous games aren't required to fully enjoy the latest one, I felt that if I played 4 it would be difficult to go backwards. So I burned through Revelations and Liberation, enjoying the former and loathing the latter. I paused on whether to play 3 given the bad criticism it received, and its collective dismissal as a worthwhile entry in the series on the Giant Bombcast was persuasive if only for an instant. I resolved to push through it though, and I'm glad I did.Assassin's Creed 3 has problems. It feels like a project that laid the groundwork for many different ideas, few of which were fully executed. Maybe it was due to incompetent direction or lack of time. The series has been reported to be headed through the annual release treatment, which no doubt puts undue pressure on teams to commit to a final product that deserves more time. Indeed, that's my biggest complaint. AC3 has an unpolished quality to it that leaves a player wondering, did they mean for this to be this way? Did they intend for naval missions to be almost entirely optional? Why are Assassin's Guild missions and the assassins themselves almost completely irrelevant to the game as a whole? Were they meant to be fun unto themselves? The developers seem to fall down when guiding the player to utilizing everything the game has to offer aside from the main quest, or just as much fails to assign real value to the side-content. It feels extraneous and unfocused.There's the main quest though, and in that you'll find a fairly interesting chapter in the struggle between the warring Templars and Assassins. Connor's struggle is more interesting than Desmond's, and I found myself wanting to spend all my time in the Animus rather than outside of it. The story is a sympathetic one that is not unlike the the conflict between Luke Skywalker and his misguided father. While the story falls apart toward the end, I enjoyed the intensity between Connor and Haytham. The game's true villain, Charles Lee, reminded me of Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal of Bill Cutting--a passionate but ruthless figure. Otherwise, it's Forrest Gump in the Revolutionary War as you fight alongside Sam Adams, ride with Paul Revere and save General Washington's army from disaster. It's fun.For me, Assassin's Creed's true value lies in Ubisoft's attempts to create authentic period pieces that you can interact with. AC3 does a great job of selling what it may have felt like to walk around in the days of 18th century Colonial America. That is what kept me playing, to be able to experience the time period in a way that movies and books can't do. This series is one of the closest means to a virtual vacation you can find, taking you to Damascus, Rome, Constantinople, and the New World. For this reason alone, AC3 is worth picking up on the cheap to see what's on offer.]]>"
Assassin's Creed III,<![CDATA[ This game is my favorite game.The quality of graphic featured in this game is thrilling.The whole story line of this game is also accurate.The design and the textures of each an every buildings that are featured in this game is accurate.this game is totally worth buying.]]>
Assassin's Creed III,"<![CDATA[I played Assassin's Creed III for the first time in 2015. Yes, I have access all the next-gen consoles and had much better games I could have been playing. However, I had some investigating to do.This game has had either a good reception or a reception that indicates it was horrible trash that ruined the franchise. I couldn't glean what exactly made it so bad from those who had such an opinion (on the internet - everybody I know in person who has played it either gave blind praise or had a negative opinion stemming from racism towards the protagonist - both views I wholeheartedly dismiss.) so I had to investigate. I also played all through the other games relatively recently - I had forced myself to play through AC and ACII for similar reasons, and suddenly gained a genuine interest in the series at the end of ACII. I had to see the end of the Desmond saga for myself, and have a more exact understanding of the games reception.So without further ado, I present to you a list of things that suck about AC3 vs. a list of things that are alright. Apologies for the deviance in review format, if you might happen to have a distaste for such things.Things that SuckHorrible garbage frame rateWorse climbing system that results in way more unintended jumping in the wrong direction, despite simplification a claim to the contrary in-gameRenovation/income system removedTemplar territory system went from go in and kill this one dude to either:  kill this dude AND light some powder kegs to control a fort which has literally no benefitdo a string of repetitive/tedious missions before you get to kill the templar leader so you can have a new assassin recruit and the UI will occasionally acknowledge the fact that the area is in Assassin controlRecruits are set with names and bios, so of course you have to work too hard to obtain them just to see the 2 cutscenes that introduce themInstead of choosing to save one of many civilians, customizing them to a degree and having the satisfaction of watching them rise through the ranks and becoming a true assassin; you get a recruit who is presumed to already be a formidable soldier yet starts as a recruit who starts off just as weak as the ones in Brotherhood and Revelations (though they don’t die - they get injured)Additions to the combat system consistently break the flow and create frustration.  The enemy types and their strengths/weaknesses are blown out of proportion; I’m sure the intention was to add complexity through the layer of memorization required, but as a result you will groan every time you see an overweight soldier because he will block your attacks and reverse your counters 9 times out of 10.Often times in the midst of combat a “firing squad” will assemble from a distance. Their muskets will bring you close to death if they hit, While the game prompts you when they are about to fire and you are tutorialized to grab a human shield in front of you, this can easily happen when you are in the midst of killing them and can’t cancel out. What’s worse, even when you are on the defense the game often doesn’t recognize the input as grabbing the human shield in the few seconds you have to react. Or sometimes it does, and the only soldiers left are the big guys who headbutt you if you try anything, and that is also their response to this.In order to access the equivalent of Assassin’s Tombs (secret missions that are on par with the quality of the main story, which unlock something cool when you complete them all) you have to collect all of Peg Leg's Trinkets, the existence of which seem completely pointless until you talk to an old man outside one specific harbor.You would think climbing trees and cliffs would be well suited to this franchise, but they only serve to assert that buildings were the right choice all along. There is nothing but absolute frustration involved. Collectibles that are placed on either are even more of a chore to collect.The children all have nightmarish proportions and have the annoying role of deliberately blocking into your path like the minstrels and beggars of past games. As what is a probably unintended consequence they cause you to be creeped out rather than annoyed, which is jarring.Killing anything that isn’t a guard or target is nigh impossible, which removes a huge degree of player choice from what is still an open world game. (Probably because there are children now, but there’s no reason this couldn’t be applied solely to them)  Killing “domestic” animals that contain fur and meat will not allow you to receive said fur and meat, on top of them being difficult to kill in the first place.Things that are alrightYou go all Travis Bickle at the end of the game and shave your hair into a mohawkVSync is implemented - no more screen tearingI thought the plot twist at the first quarter of the game was pretty cool and well writtenThe father/son dynamic between Haytham and Connor is really interestingAs someone who isn’t American and thus, hasn’t had American history shoved down his throat, I found this to be the most palatable form of media depicting the American revolution I have come across. The game was also pretty good at distinguishing what is fiction and what is actually recorded history through the Animus databaseCharles Lee is changed from a somewhat loathable, minor figure in American history into a very effective, evil villainThere is only much regression in comparison to the prior 2 games - much has improved objectively over the original AC and ACIIThis is the first game to truly portray Templars as anything other than absolute power hungry, depraved dictatorial villains (though mostly through Haytham, who seems to have an obsessive need to find moral justification in his cause and actions)You can hunt a variety of animals, skin them and sell their parts or use them to craft stuff. I beat the game and somehow haven’t unlocked the ability to craft, though.They added animals (that aren’t horses) and children for the first time! Animals are well animated and add to the atmosphere. See the above category in regards to the children.I found the parts where Desmond was playable to be thoroughly enjoyable. Especially Brazil, where civilians will declare you insane and call for security to no avail a countless amount of times, and where you will climb across the catwalk above a UFC match where two men will do nothing but stare at each other inside the octagon. One of them definitely has a hoodie and jeans on. Truly some of the best dumb stuff in a video game.So ultimately, I recommend ACIII for those who have interest in the storyline, for those who have a high tolerance for frustrating design choices, and those who are able to laugh at a game for being dumb, whether or not it is intentionally so. If you can't stomach the fictitious thought of a half-British, half-Mohawk assassin secretly being the most pivotal part of the American revolution, then turn away.I can't say I enjoyed all of my time with Assassin's Creed III, but overall I'm glad to have experienced it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[By the time I reached the end of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I felt exhausted and relieved. I was so happy to see the credits, to finally complete the story. Not because I expected some grand ending, or because I had enjoyed the journey and wished to see how it all ended.The reason I was so relieved at finally beating this game was simple: Its too long and filled with too much unnecessary content.This is the 6th game in the main series, but if you start counting other games like Liberation, Bloodlines and that awful mobile game this is like the 324th Assassin's Creed game. I joke, but this series has grown very large and very fast. Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag tries to freshen up this annualized series- with mixed results.One new change is you play as a pirate. A full fledged, rum drinking, ship boarding, swashbuckling pirate. This isn't just a gameplay change though, it also allows Ubisoft Montreal to change the way the story feels. No longer are you some depressed man who doesn't really like being an Assassin.....but he is sooo.. he just deals with it. No, now you're a fun loving, money hunting pirate. It allows the game to have more exciting moments, and lets you enjoy not only being a pirate but also a badass Assassin. Edward Kenway, the character you play as, is a fun character to watch. He does what he wants and seems more concerned over gold then some noble creed to live by. Its a nice change to the series' regular protagonists, like Altair or Connor.Another change is focus on sea combat and travel. Assassin's Creed III introduced the concept of naval combat, but ACIV not only expands on naval gameplay, but makes it more important. You now have a huge ocean to explore. Inside this huge world, you will find islands, sand bars, coral reefs, sunken ships, whales, sharks, forts and more. Unlike ACIII, where the ship felt cut off from the game, in ACIV there are no loading screens to deal with. If you want to just jump on your boat and blow stuff up, then just climb aboard and go blow stuff up. Its smooth and works great. Cruising around Cuba, or the tip of Florida while your crew sings old sea shanties and you look off into the distance with a spyglass- looking for your next destination, you actually feel like a pirate. Its impressive and genuinely fun.The improved and expanded naval component of ACIV just reminds you of how little the series has improved it's actual on foot gameplay. You will still run up walls randomly. Jumping to a certain location or air assassinating a target never feels consistent. The classic ""Trying to climb the top of a building and then your character decides to jump off instead of up"" moment returns. Worst still, parkour-ing around the city, while visually impressive, is still just holding the trigger and moving forward. After so many games these issues are still a part of the series, and its hard to ignore them.Moreover, stealth has seen some improvements. You can lean around a corner and grab someone for instance. Mission design has improved, so stealth feels like a viable and fun option. But these improvements are small, and are overshadowed by repetitive gameplay. The amount of times I found someone, then trailed them, then stayed close enough to hear them then killed them is insane. It borders on laziness. After about 10 hours, I realized that there were basically 4-5 missions in the game. You repeat these missions over and over and over. Sure the location is different or the character you assassinate has changed, but the basic structure is copy and pasted so many times that it becomes tedious and boring. On the plus side Ubisoft has included a mission rating feature, so at the end of a mission you can rate it 1 to 5 stars. Hopefully this will help future games in making better missions.Copy and pasted missions are a little more tolerable if the story is worth your time.Sadly that's not really the case here. With Black Flag, you sort of get 2 stories. One is good and the other is pretty bad. You start the game and luckily its filled with action and exploration right off the get go, unlike ACIII's 10 hours tutorial. You discover the Assassins, then the Templars, then the figthing between the two is explained a bit. Following that the game introduces a Macguffin that both the Templars and Assassin's want. Edward, your character, wants it to, but to sell it and become rich. But after 3 or so hours that story stops, and you begin another story line, this one being all about pirates.The pirate storyline is really good, sometimes the writing or pacing feels weird, but overall meeting Blackbeard and Charles Vane is cool. You also get to explore Kingston, Nassau and other West Indies cities and ports. During this part of the story the game just kind stops caring about the whole Asssasin's Creed universe and as a result it feels fun and exciting.Being a pirate is something very few games let you do, and Assassins Creed IV does it really well.Throughout the game you will occasionally pop out of the Animus and walk around an Abestero Game development studio. These modern day segments are few and far between, and really feel stale and lifeless. I never felt like spending any time in the office, especially considering that the only thing to do out there is hack computers via minigames. If your wondering how this game ties into the Assassin's Creed mythos and timeline, alot of that is done in the modern day. Some of it feels cool but most of it feels rushed, especially towards the end of the game. In the last 3 hours or so of the story the game wraps up all the pirate fun and goes back to the Assassins vs. Templars storyline. But it quickly become convoluted, and soon I was just wishing the game had ended sooner. By the time the game does wrap up, it feels rushed and the ending comes so abruptly that it left a really sour taste in my mouth. I felt like I had wasted my time and thats a really bad feeling for a game thats over 20 hours to invoke.There is a LOT to do and collect in this game. But everything feels so repetitive. After you board a boat you get the same short cut-scene, every time. After you play the whaling missions a few times you realize that every sea creature you fight has the same patterns and AI. Going underwater, a neat idea, was for me a lot less fun due to poor controls. Attacking a fort, is again the same fort, just copied and pasted around the map. You attack from your ship, then go on foot and kill some commanders to take it over. The same cutscene plays and the end, and the forts contain the same layout. Its dull and tedious, and quickly I found my self ignoring everything this game was offering.One other feature is a ""Fleet"" that you can build up and control. You send them out to do missions and make you gold. While its neat to have a fleet built up of ships you have stolen, it feels more like a Facebook game. You wait hours for missions to finish, use gems to fix ships and friends help your ships. Its all menu and text based, and never felt fun or worth my time.Finally, there is multiplayer. Its fun, at least I thought so. I have always enjoyed the Assassins Creed multiplayer. It always felt so radically different from other online game experiences like Call of Duty or Halo. And with ACIV they've added more weapons and perks and upgrades, but if you were not a fan of multiplayer in previous AC games, then there is nothing new or interesting here that would convince you otherwise. In fact veterans of the series may find the online offerings so similar that it becomes less exciting to play. There are also some micro-transactions and pay to win elements, that while not a huge deal-breaker, feel gross and out of place.Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is just too big. The story is excessively long and doesn't feel satisfying. The amount of copy and paste missions and side activities is disappointing and quickly creates a sense of tedium. Naval combat, while fun and improved, only highlights how foot combat, stealth and on foot controls have the same issues 6 games later. Assassin's Creed IV feels like playing a 2 hour game, 12 times in a row. You do the same thing over and over, and quickly wonder why your playing at all. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[Pirates are awesome, and don’t let anybody tell you differently. From movies to books and now to video games, pirates will forever be that representation of a free spirit taking their own lives and making something of them by any means necessary. So it’s no wonder that the Assassin’s Creed franchise wanted to make use of them and add them to their impressive repertoire of historical figures. And you know what? It actually works. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is the series fully realized. The story is grand and epic, the gameplay refined, the visuals stunning as always, and it more than makes up for the disappointments that Assassin’s Creed III, though great, suffered in its launch. The game immediately thrusts you into the life of Edward Kenway, a privateer turned pirate around the era known as the “golden age of piracy,” specifically the third and final stretch lasting from 1716 to around 1726. He also happens to be the father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor Kenway, the main characters of Assassin’s Creed III. Edward gets shipwrecked by a member of the Assassin Order, who on his way to Havana, Cuba to meet up with some important people and collect a big reward. But Edward later kills him and goes to Havana himself to collect the late assassin’s payment. Upon reaching the city and meeting with the assassin’s contacts, he soon finds himself caught in the middle of the war between the Assassins and Templars: the main conflict within the franchise. He figures the best way to collect a fortune from these two groups is to become a pirate with no loyalties except to himself and his crew, and so begins his adventure. As for the modern day portion of the game, which has been established since the beginning, you no longer control Desmond Miles on account of him having a severe case of death in the previous installment. Instead, you now control a nameless, faceless employee of Abstergo Entertainment, a brand of Abstergo Industries that’s focused on making virtual reality video games based on collected memories from certain individuals with interesting ancestors. This section serves more as a small continuation of the story instead of further development for main characters, who are demoted to cameos and smaller roles this time around. There is a side story involved with collecting information for the Assassins from Abstergo Entertainment, but this only feels a little arbitrary and doesn’t really add much other than some moments of background info from the time in between games, to a few chuckle-worthy instances of meta-humor, where the game makes fun of itself as well as the franchise in general. Otherwise, it is written well and does serve to keep newer players in the loop, even if some dialogue pieces keep important information in the dark a while. Where the narrative remains strong, however, is within the memories of the ancestor you play as, and Edward Kenway makes his case as a charismatic, swashbuckling rogue with a sympathetic side in the form of protecting those he considers both friend and family. He has a wife, and leaving her to become a privateer/pirate doesn’t leave much room for them to grow in a relationship. Seeing how they both develop within small flashbacks makes you feel sorry for Edward, as every bad decision he makes drives him away from the family he could potentially have. His growth throughout the game is nothing short of impressive, and almost echoes Ezio’s story in terms of raw emotion. This kind of development can also be seen in the side cast. And what a cast this is. Along his adventure, Edward meets up with several historical pirates, all of whom existed, even if their stories are changed to fit the fiction of the series. You meet up with notorious buccaneers like Edward Thatch A.K.A Blackbeard, the most famous and fearsome of pirates; John “Calico Jack” Rackham, the designer of the famous Jolly Roger; Anne Bonny and Mary Read, two of the most famed female pirates ever; and many more including Bartholomew “Black Bart” Roberts, Charles Vane, Ben Hornigold, and Stede Bonnet. Every pirate is as ruthless and vicious as their legends suggest, but the writers decided to show them as what they truly were: honest human beings who fell into difficult times and saw no other options besides leading a life of adventure, greed, and anarchy. They’re painted with real human emotion and motive, a far cry from the bloodthirsty demons of the sea that many portray pirates to be, and the story is all the better for it, even if individual arcs tend to be done as soon as a character reaches enlightenment. The game takes place around parts in the Greater Antilles of the Caribbean Sea. The main cities seen are Havana, Kingston, and Nassau in the Bahamas. The landscapes in this game are nothing short of breathtaking. You see the beach coasts of most ports and the cities, and you’re treated to some of the most beautiful vistas in any video game to date. From sheer rock cliffs pouring a waterfall over a beach, to straits beset with cliffs that would be a ship’s worst nightmare, and vast rainforests within many of the islands, this game is gorgeous in every sense of the word, and everything can be accessed on a whim, as the game features no loading screens between many islands, coves, and the ocean itself apart from the major cities, and even then, there’s no framerate drops or stuttering when this occurs. This game is a great example of how to make your visuals stable while retaining some level of constant playability. Speaking of playability, let’s finally get to the gameplay, which is the best the series has ever had. The core gameplay is still standard of the Assassin’s Creed franchise. You base your moves around two styles: low and high profile. By using the face buttons, you’re able to control parts of Edward’s body corresponding to each of his limbs. In low profile (standard movement), these are used to blend into your surroundings, jump, and occasionally pickpocket innocent civilians for a few extra coins. This is best used when you have to sneak your way around guards, as the game places a high emphasis on stealth this time around. You can whistle to attract a guard’s attention before moving somewhere else, hide behind corners, and walk among the crowds to become incognito. You can even assassinate or knock people out from these positions, and there are plenty of vantage points to be found for the best tactical advantage. High profile moves are where you find the most actions. When you press the free-running button and keep it held, you’re given the opportunity to trek across the landscape in style, while running the risk of attracting unwanted attention. You can climb up buildings, run across them in various feats of agility and speed, and kill guards at high speeds. Climbing has been improved upon since the previous game, however, as there are more buildings, trees, cliffs, and more to climb up and create your own courses to run through. The only issue with it is one that has plagued the series since the beginning, and that’s the questionable accuracy of the climbing itself. You’ll often run into walls that you want to climb but Edward decides not to, you’ll jump off a roof to another one only to be shoved off to the right or left through no fault of your own, and often there will be moments where you become stuck on a climb even though you see more points of articulation right overhead. These happen often, but are easily overcome and are only minor annoyances to fans of the series. Combat remains same at a core level, but has been refined to feel more fluid and aggressive, as pirates were known for their guerilla style of warfare. Emphasis has been placed on attacking your enemies first while paying attention to counter-attack indicators as in previous games. You can easily take out the normal enemies with a combo string, but not all of them go down easy. There are smaller rogue-like enemies that can catch you if you run away, and will easily block your attacks unless you break their defense first. Brutes also become a threat, as they can easily ruin your combo, and will toss grenades now and again for added damage. The best tactic against them is to either sneak up on them, or break their defense and disarm them. Enemies will still attack you one at a time, which has been both a blessing and a curse since day one of the series, as it both simplifies and reduces challenge, while also giving you a fair chance to look like a badass. A big change in this game is the increased emphasis on the naval gameplay first introduced in Assassin’s Creed III. You take control of the Jackdaw, Edward’s ship, often throughout the game as a means of traveling through the massive overworld’s ocean. Along the way, you’ll battle against thick fogs that hinder your navigation, furious storms that threaten to tear your ship apart, and vicious gusts of wind that steer you off-course in an instant. It’s a cohesive world, where you can sail from two islands and explore them without having to worry about a loading screen, apart from entering major cities or starting various missions. The world feels alive too, since you come across numerous ships sailing, whales breeching along the waters, and birds flying around to catch some fish no matter where you go. It all goes to show how much detail went into making sure there was plenty to do without a single break in between. Apart from the regular story missions, there are numerous side activities to partake in. The most exciting thing is taking part in naval combat, which has been fleshed out considerably while also maintaining a streamlined approach for easier access. You have numerous weapons at your disposal such as cannons, mortars, fire barrels, and chain shots to try and take an enemy ship down. Aiming can be tricky since you not only have to account for your opponent, but also the dynamic dangers present in choppy waters, waterspouts, and the occasional strong gust of wind. Thankfully, the Jackdaw controls smoothly, and never fights against you in the thick of battle. There are numerous enemy types to fight. You have small gunboats that are easy to manage, schooners who are fast and difficult to keep track of, brigs that charge towards you, frigates that get more powerful as you progress, to giant man o’wars that carry over one-hundred cannons that can rip your ship apart in seconds. There are even pirate hunter ships that chase you when your notoriety gets too high. You can board the larger ships once you deal enough damage to them, which require you to defeat a number of the remaining crew to fully take over. You then have the option of repairing the Jackdaw, lowering your wanted level, or sending the ship to Edward’s fleet, which can be sent on missions outside the world map, not unlike the assassin missions see in previous games. You can upgrade the Jackdaw with the various resources you collect from taking ships down. Things like sugar and rum can be sold for cash, while wood, cloth, and metal can be used to increase the number of cannons on the Jackdaw, improve the strength of the hull, add a battering ram on the front, and even create different colored sails. You can even improve the strength of your whaling boat and harpoons, as well as buy different artifacts to decorate your ship. Aside from the combat, there are other things you can do for resources and finances. You can take up assassination contracts for extra coin. Finding a wrecked ship along the expanse of the Caribbean Sea enables you to dive underwater to collect its sunken booty while avoiding sharks, moray eels, and the chance to drown. Thankfully, the game’s underwater controls are solid, if a little jerky at times when trying to round sharp corners or enter smaller areas. You can hunt for animal skins to upgrade Edward’s armor, weapons, and the amount of guns and ammo he can carry at once. Whaling and shark-hunting provides an opportunity to collect on more skins, but require you to go to certain spots to harpoon the giant beasts, which offer some challenge, but become simple due to their predictable AI patterns. You can take down naval forts to unlock more of the map, which can be just as tough as regular naval battles due to their enhanced firepower, but thankfully remain stationary. There are numerous collectibles as well, such as treasure chests, messages in bottles that provide more insight into the lore of the time period, treasure maps that not only have large amounts of gold, but also give customization plans that you wouldn’t otherwise acquire on your own. There are even animus fragments and challenges that can be found to unlock cheats and multiplayer options. Wait, there’s multiplayer? It was first introduced in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, the multiplayer of the universe remains as popular and intense as ever. You enter the lobby to create a match, join one, or customize your character with unlockable perks, skins, and various other options like emblems. Once you start a match, you can choose a map to play on, and one of three modes. The first is Manhunt, which is a cat-and-mouse type of game. You play on a team of four, and are given the task of either finding members of the opposite team and killing them, or hiding from the opposite team while they search for you. You earn points from either the style of assassination, the length of time you spend hiding—either alone or with your team—somewhere, or by assisting your team either by healing or with a kill. The team with the most points after two rounds (once as predator, the other as prey), wins the match. The second mode is called Domination, which is essentially a free-for-all mode where the player with the most points wins. In both modes, you play on large maps riddled with hiding spots, climbable buildings, and even NPCs that can either aid or hinder you. In either mode, killing a target other than your intended one will result in a five-second penalty where you cannot perform a single action. You use your boosters to either toss money into crowds, create a disguise to confuse your assailant, and many more that can be unlocked by leveling up. The third mode is called Wolfpack: a mode introduced in Assassin’s Creed III, and it’s a checkpoint-based co-op mode where you and three other friends are tasked with taking down specific targets in a given amount of time. You all seek out your opponent amongst the crowds, and behaves much like a story assassination mission would. You scope the place out, locate your target, and find the proper means of taking them down, sometimes with added bonus objectives to challenge your skills. There are no other modes included, so multiplayer is essentially the same, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. There’s really nothing negative to say about this game, aside from the large number of gameplay and visual glitches that can easily take you out of the experience, and the same predictable and easily exploited AI that the series has been known for. Other than that, this is possibly the best game in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. The smoother controls in free-running and combat, the open-world naval experience that’s second to none, the compelling and interesting narrative with some of the most colorful characters, and a modern day story that, while not perfect, is still intriguing and at times funny in its meta-humor. This is the closest the series has gotten to achieving the balance it’s strived for since the beginning, and you’ll be hard-pressed to tell yourself that the previous games were any better as a whole than this one. Rating: 9.5 out of 10 (numerous bugs and glitches, predictable AI patterns, modern-day story is lacking)]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[ In a mere seven years, there have been six Assassin’s Creed games. Though there are sports titles and multiplayer shooters that have held similar release schedules over the generation, it is a feat largely unheard of for longer, story-focused games. The potential perils of this accelerated release schedule appeared to surface in 2012 with Assassin’s Creed 3, which was met with a tepid response. Thankfully, with Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Ubisoft appear to have righted the course and have delivered a memorable, enjoyable, piratical experience. The core tropes and formulas of the series remain largely unchanged in Black Flag, splitting the players’ duties across two disparate time periods. The majority of the game is spent piloting Edward Kenway, Caribbean pirate from the 1800’s around the West Indies, committing acts of piracy and butting heads with the Templars and Assassins. The other part is played as a nameless, faceless cipher in the modern day. Beginning his career in game development at Abstergo Entertainment, your cipher is tasked with creating a pirate-themed game for release by Ubisoft. It’s delightfully meta, and exploring the modern day Abstergo offices allows for more than a handful of decent gags about the past of the Assassin’s Creed franchise. Players looking for solace or closure following the events of Assassin’s Creed 3 will be disappointed, as the game successfully relegates all previous actions and themes to barely a blip on the radar: a familiar face here, a ghostly image there. Assassin’s Creed 4 appears to be a definitive cut away from the ties of the previous games.Kenway, as a playable character is immediately more likeable than his silent, brooding equivalent from Assassin’s Creed 3. He is a charismatic, yet flawed individual, harkening back to the glory days of running around Italy as Ezio Auditore. Following an ambush from the British, Kenway stumbles onto a map and delicate trinket on the corpse of a soldier, detailing the locations of secret Assassin bases and an individual known as the Sage, who knows the location of an ancient MacGuffin temple, The Observatory. After delivering the items to a templar higher up in exchange for a small reward, Kenway sets into motion a series of events that sees both warring factions jostling for power and survival. Kenway, on the other hand, just wants to get rich.Though it’s a tried and true pirate tale, Kenway is ultimately a good man at heart, despite his reluctance to admit it. Whilst his murderous, clandestine ways cannot be excused by any rational man, he aims to simply make enough coin to appease his wife’s father and live comfortably with her back in London. In order to make these dreams a reality, he sails the open seas on board the Jackdaw, his faithful ship, in an effort to make a big score. Kenway is led to Nassau early in the story, the pirate island of legend – no laws, no rules, just the desire of man. Here, a number of fellow pirates enlist Kenway’s help to undertake missions around the Caribbean in order to gain as much plunder as possible, or to atone for his own mistakes. The Caribbean itself is a truly fantastic setting for a video game, and was excellently capitalised on by Ubisoft. The seas feel huge and expansive, rolling in all directions as far as the eye can see, littered with small sandy atolls and other ships. Within the seas are around two dozen unique islands, littered with tropes of the series – high viewpoints for synchronization, hidden treasures and collectibles that fill out the pirates’ view of the world from the 1800s. Each island is a small, carefully crafted experience to explore and discover, with little repetition shared amongst them. The larger islands contain small cities, allowing for classic Assassin’s Creed gameplay – stalking enemies along rooftops and from behind corners, blending into citizens to strike at the perfect moment.Sailing the open seas is a novel experience from beginning to end. Ships handle similarly to how they did in Assassin’s Creed 3, however, they have been loosened up a tad, making them a bit easier to navigate. Just as on land, there are a number of different approaches the player can use to attack other ships or forts when at sea. From heavy and light cannons to mortar shots, rams and flaming barrels, it’s easy to create your own play style and adapt it quickly to fit the needs of an encounter. Ships range from the small gunboats to massive Man o’ Wars, so it is imperative to ensure the correct tactic is used at the right time. Aiming cannon blasts has been eased slightly since Connor’s forays into the open seas, meaning the naval combat is easy to control and satisfying to win. When an enemy ship has been bombarded to the point of near collapse, the player can choose to board this ship in order to elicit further rewards. In order to complete the boarding, a number of objectives must be completed, usually focussed around eliminating a certain number of enemy combatants or removing a key part of the ship. The difficulty of these objectives is determined by the size of the ship: A small gunboat might only require five kills to complete successfully, but boarding a frigate will result in a massive, drawn out swordfight. The loot received from the other ship can be used to upgrade a number of systems onboard the Jackdaw, making the naval skirmishes not only incredibly satisfying, but gameplay relevant as well. The ship combat is pulled off spectacularly, and it is a wonder why there haven’t been any more piracy-themed games in recent memory.Black Flag is a stunning looking game, especially if played on the new generation of consoles. Gamers left in the past need not despair, however, as the older systems are just as capable at creating a spectacular looking title. On the 360, Black Flag is a wonderful reminder than even with lagging technology, developers can create something truly magical. The textures, lighting and facial effects are all done impeccably, with few stutters, framerate drops or slow loads. From the brilliantly bright blues of the sea to the deep, dark greens and greys of the jungle, Black Flag is a visual tour-de-force rarely seen from this generation. The dynamically changing weather is a treat on the open seas as well, with thunderstorms, twisters and turbulent seas battering ships realistically. As a purely graphical experience, Black Flag easily ranks alongside of The Last of Us or Far Cry 3. It is a spectacular visual experience.The soundtrack is strong and fits well, a consistent trope of the series. The most enjoyable thing about the soundtrack, however, has to be the sea shanties your crew members sing when sailing around the open seas. It helps speed the travel times between portions of the map and is a humorous, light-hearted moment wonderfully juxtaposed with the impassioned screaming during naval battles. As a good soundtrack should, it adds to the overall experience and makes it that much more memorable.It seems for all the strengths of the core game, however, the outside the Animus moments are comparatively quite weak. Played from the first person perspective, you are able to explore a small development studio and a number of other smaller locations in the Abstergo Entertainment building. There is a weak sub-plot involving hacking computers and delivering data to some familiar Assassins, however, these segments fall especially flat. With the soulless, faceless shell of your player not being able to speak, there is a definite cognitive dissonance created when characters are speaking directly to you. When the rest of the game is so packed full of personality, it is extremely unsatisfying to play as a mute cipher. The small hacking puzzles that constitute the gameplay in these sections are far from satisfying, either, consisting of a Frogger derivative; a small, Sonic 3 inspired spherical puzzle; and some maths. At least the rewards for these segments are worthwhile – videos, audio files and documents relating to the world of the Assassin’s from the Templars perspective for once. Though Desmond’s story was once the most interesting thing in the series, it is difficult not to feel as though the creative team are grasping at straws. It feels rushed, poorly put together and, perhaps most damning of all, boring. Were it not for the sometime truly fascinating rewards, it would be easy to recommend avoiding entirely.Multiplayer makes its return once again, largely unaltered from the previous three iterations. There have been a number of smart alterations that will be noticeable to players already deeply engrossed into the gameplay, but from a layman’s perspective will be largely unseen. Players choose one of a dozen unique playable characters that then seed the world, tasked with eliminating a specific other player in a sea of similar faces. It is a game of deduction and disguise as much as it is about agility, making it enjoyable to even the worst of multiplayer gamers. Characters can be customised as they level up, adding the slightest hint of personality to a game about similarities. It’s enjoyable, easy to learn and satisfying to win – but so have been the previous three iterations.Ultimately, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is a surprising, charming return to form for a seemingly lagging series. Though the additions to naval combat are highly enjoyable and the game is a graphical masterpiece, the truly amazing part of the game is how much raw personality and charisma they manage to shove into a 20-hour experience. Though the world is large and expansive, it never loses its charm and feels narratively consistent, from beginning to end. The journey of Kenway is fun, memorable and enjoyable, filled with incredible, instantly unforgettable characters.At the conclusion of the game, there is a quiet moment that plays for but a few seconds. Kenway, sitting alone in the same tavern at Nassau that he has inhabited since the beginning of the game, has received a note that someone very important is coming to meet him at the docks. Realizing that his time as a pirate is coming to an end, he farewells the locals at the tavern and glances back at the once-empty table he sat at. He sees the friends and family he lost along the journey, who raise a glass and look back, before he turns away and leaves to start his new life. It is a short, poignant moment that took me by complete surprise. I came to the realisation that I was sad to be saying goodbye to these characters I’d gotten to know over the course of the game, a sign of truly magnificent writing and characterisation. It is emblematic of sheer amount of personality and charm that was crammed into the game; emblematic of how great the series can be. It reinforced the notion that Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is a wonderful, astonishing title well worth picking up, and a fitting coda to the generation. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[It’s funny how it goes, sometimes. I’ve been pretty down on the state of AAA games for a while. Aside from a handful of great titles earlier in the year, the release schedule has been pretty bleak lately, filled with the kinds of games that make me embarrassed for the state of the medium, and sometimes its critics, too. Ironic, then, that it is an entry in a major, annualized franchise that has made me genuinely excited about blockbuster games again, doubly so because the last two major entries in the Assassin’s Creed franchise have been somewhat disappointing. Neither game managed to significantly shake up the formula, instead adding in new elements and systems that felt tacked on and out of place, like pineapple on pizza. Assassin’s Creed III added the excellent sailing mechanics, but struggled to meaningfully integrate it into the game. Similarly, Revelations had a woefully out of place tower defense-style mini game, which felt about as thematically appropriate as it sounds. Assassin’s Creed IV takes what worked in the previous entries, discards most of the superfluous mechanics, and focuses on its core strengths, resulting in a game that is the best entry in the series to date.By simply excising the filler elements from previous games, Black Flag addresses one of the worst parts of the last two games: It took them hours and hours to stop teaching the player their myriad systems and properly get started. Edward Kenway, the protagonist of AC IV, acquires the tools of the Assassins’ trade almost immediately, and it’s a refreshingly slim tool set. The lean weapon selection gives the player the required tools to expedite combat, escape it, or avoid it altogether, without complicating things by having the ability to create a hundred kind of bombs, like Revelations did. There are some getting-to-know-you missions in Havana before Edward acquires the Jackdaw, his ship, but the impatient player can get through these quickly enough, and even so they at least involve more than only walking and talking, like many of the early missions in AC III. Once Edward, and the player, have their hands on the Jackdaw’s wheel, the game opens up in a grand way. The freedom of the beautiful Caribbean ocean is intoxicating at first, with opportunities to get into trouble presenting themselves regularly. It’s an absolutely gorgeous place, too, with its inviting clear blue water, even bluer skies, and white beaches. The first time I saw a whale splashing down close to the Jackdaw, my jaw hit the floor, and it happens infrequently enough that it doesn’t really get old. The ocean is dotted with little islands filled with side quests and treasure that beg to be explored. Best of all, there’s actually a reason to want to find treasure and earn money. Upgrading the Jackdaw is an expensive business that will have you eyeing the mini map for treasure chest icons, and it’s paced just right so that by the time it’s fully upgraded, the end of the game will most likely be in sight.On land, it’s business as usual, and this is where the age of the underlying systems occasionally gets in the way of enjoyment. Combat can get repetitive, as it’s rarely challenging, and especially boarding enemy ships to get valuable upgrade materials grew to feel like a chore about halfway through. The free running mechanics are also in dire need of an overhaul, as it’s starting to feel overly clunky and mechanical, rather than liberating. Fortunately, these elements feel somewhat de-emphasized. It is easier to be stealthy or to avoid combat than it has been in past games, and combat encounters generally feel shorter. There is still satisfaction to be had in chaining a succession of kills together, even if it is mechanically shallow, or by planning a stealthy approach and executing on it, or using a berserk dart and simply letting the enemies kill each other while you watch or slip by unnoticed. It still serves the game moderately well, but I don’t think they can get away with reusing the same mechanics next year.Naval combat is where the game shines, though. Ship combat requires some element of strategy when battling a force of several ships, as positioning and speed play an important role. Add in dense smoke clouds from the cannons, occasional severe weather conditions like hurricanes, rogue waves and twisters, and some truly intense and hectic battles can emerge. It feels, to use an overused word, cinematic, but without robbing the player of control. Enemy ships can be boarded when they are dead in the water, which is very cool at first, as you swing from your ship to theirs and fight amidst a smoking hulk alongside your crew, but it takes long enough that at some point I started wishing I could expedite the process somehow.The disparate elements all work fine in their own right, but it’s the seamless nature of the experience is what makes it work. Simply standing on the deck of the Jackdaw, picking a destination on the map, sailing to it, letting yourself get distracted by something you see on the way, like a whale to harpoon, and then doing it, creates this sense of freedom that captures the essence of the ideal of being a pirate. The only loading screens are encountered when fast travelling or when going into one of the three major cities: Havana, Kingston and Nassau. It feels organic in a way that no past game in the franchise has. Contributing to this is the feeling that all aspects of the game reinforce one another. Most everything you do on land goes towards upgrading the Jackdaw, which will make you more powerful at sea. This lets you more easily take out naval forts, which unlocks new side quests, and so on. It’s a very satisfying feedback loop, something approaching holistic design.Aside from the design of the open world, Black Flag's story is the most praiseworthy element of the game, though it goes largely unsung. Perhaps it isn’t what most would expect from a yearly franchise published by a major video game house, but it truly stands out here, surpassing previous games easily and setting a new bar for storytelling in open world games. Pushing aside most of the baggage of previous games, the story focuses on Edward Kenway and his friends and rivals, to great success. Unlike previous protagonists, Edward doesn’t actually become an assassin until very, very late in the game. He simply wants to get rich and live a good life. The story is a slow burn, but this works to the game’s advantage. Edward’s goals early on in the game mirror those of the player, and it isn’t until later on that Edward starts to wonder if he’s on the right path in life. His story is grounded in humanity, has a narrative arc that actually works as an open world game (an exceedingly rare quality), and eschews the sci-fi plot twists that characterized the endings of some previous Assassin’s Creed games. It’s still larger than life, but essentially it’s about men struggling to remain relevant in a world that’s leaving them behind, about identity and purpose, and about friendship and responsibility.All of the disparate elements of Assassin’s Creed IV combine to create an experience that is much better than any one of its constituent parts might suggest in a vacuum. It gives the player the means to go out there and be a pirate, to explore and to fight, creating a great sense of freedom. Assassin’s Creed IV is simply a triumph in open-world game design.Originally posted on my tumblr: http://dailygamed.tumblr.com/post/68487685548/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[First, I just want to say that I've played to completion all of the Assassin's Creed games, except Revelations, and by the end of each one I was completing it simply out of sheer will. They were mostly good games, except AC3 which was just terrible, that overstayed their welcome and ended up leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Luckily, AC4 is exactly the opposite.The game starts you off immediately on the right track, killing dudes, and you never stop! It has the best combat of the series, refining the best elements of the earlier games and including firearms in a believable and not annoying way. The stealth elements are still not great, but there are so few 100% stealth missions, and the combat is so good that I didn't mind that I'd get caught, because then I could just murder some more.The game is just beautiful on PS4. This is exactly what I wanted out of the next generation of consoles! I'm sure the framerate was locked at 30 fps, but I never noticed, because it never dropped and always felt super smooth.I don't want to spoil the story, but you don't play as an actual assassin which has some great benefits to the game. Firstly, it gives a fresh perspective on the events portrayed. Secondly, and more importantly, I felt that as a player it didn't matter that I was completely terrible at being stealthy. I took out my swords more than my hidden blades, and I used my pistol to assassinate my targets just as often as not. It made sense that the story being told matched the character I was playing.There are 100% synchronizing optional objectives for each mission, but unlike AC3, they are doable and fun to try, and subtle when you fail. You don't get a big red message telling you how much you suck, you just don't get the points at the end of the mission. It added depth, not frustration, and was a great addition to the game. As was the ability to rate each main mission from 1-5 stars. Anytime I had to eavesdrop, the mission was 1 star, hopefully everybody does this and Ubisoft gets the message.The meta story, which has always been my least favorite aspect of the series (excluding, of course, the eavesdropping), somehow managed to become the part of the story I was most engaged with. It's a slightly veiled version of Ubisoft working on a game (movie? virtual experience? Something like that) that a large corporation is stifling. It's great! In addition, I was impressed when it manages to actually connect with the Assassin's Creed world in more tangible ways. The main story of Edward Kenway was great too. It was light on actual plot, but heavy on characters, and while I didn't remember a lot of names and faces during the story, the effect was still there. The ending was superb, not that I was expecting much after AC3.There's so much else to talk about in this game. The side missions are quick and fun to digest. In my many, many hours of playing the game I collected every secret, every chest, every animus fragment, every shanty (which is the best collectable in recent memory, maybe ever), I did every assassination and every Templar Hunt (which had really good short stories in them) and discovered every location and captured every fort. I haven't touched the navel contracts, yet. My point being somehow AC4 was able to buck the trend of every one of its predecessors, I actually want to play the game more!Play this game if you have any interest in pirates, open worlds, stabbing dudes over and over again and you won't regret it. Fear not the stink of Assassin's Creed III, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the game you've been aching for, and more!]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[ For me, the AC series have always been a pretty mediocre series at best (3 stars at the best), but I do tend to come back to it each year when its on sale during black friday. Comfort food you'd call it. This year is a bit different. This is the first AC game that I enjoyed doing most of the side stuff. It ended up scratching an itch that is purely reserved for mmos. So while the gameplay is mediocre and janky asscreed, there is enough things to do with enough rewards to compel me to finish the game at 85% completion which is way more than any other ac game. Really the only cons of this is the crazy amounts of tailing and 'avoid all combat optional objective' and the lack of many melee weapon types. Otherwise the sea combat is fun, the visuals are gorgeous on pc and next gen.... its well worth digging into. Heck it even broke the trend of an AC game with a complete bonkers ending! Imagine that.It's probably the must have launch title on next consoles if you don't want a shooter or sports game. Enough stuff to keep ya busy for a long ass while. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[This is the first Assassin's Creed game I have ever bought and boy oh boy was I pleasantly surprised by it. It's clear to me that Ubisoft does not want to let it's golden IP run dry like other game series have let happen in the past. There is tonnes of stuff to do in this vast open world and all of it falling perfectly in line with the pirate theme Ubisoft has created for us. Following maps to find buried treasure is fun, finding all the collectibles are fun, and of course being a pirate is great. I'll be totally honest when I say that while playing this game I barely followed the story at all. I had no idea what was going up until the final few missions and everything concluded. I simply played this game because it was a fun, good looking game; and there is nothing wrong with that. I will talk briefly about the story and the mechanics of it. The missions are a bit similar being changed up here and there with some sailing missions. Trailing someone and eavesdropping is lots of fun, because you have to be quick and always know where the next spot your going to run to will be. However I found that because I was so focused on trailing or in the event of eavesdropping staying within range. I often didn't hear what the characters I was trailing were talking about. Leaving me in the dark about why I was about to kill this person. The character models, acting, and animation is all great, sometimes the facial animation is a bit jagged (comparing to GTA V) but over all a great treat to watch. The world it self is beautiful and always has something interesting to look at. Whether you are in the city of Havana looking at all the commotion or sailing the high seas and taking in the amazing water engine in this game. It all looks great. There is also very little tearing and texture pop issues involved. Overall it's just a very immersive game. I've played the multiplayer a bit now, even helped beta test it during the summer, however it just doesn't resonate well with me. Ubisoft needs to come up with a clear cut way on how to pace multiplayer. When playing in a match where 4 people are trying to be stealthy and get high point kills are interrupted by 2 people who are running around trying to rack up as many low point kills as possible, it ruins the atmosphere of a stealthy assassin game. I think this game is best served through the single player campaign.MULTIPLAYER:I'm trying so hard to get to level 55 in the multiplayer but this game makes that one heck of a frustrating journey. Between the terrible path finding skills of the NPCs often leading your position to be shown, the game being slow to notify that you saw your pursuer or your abilities taking a second to long to activate this is one of the most frustrating multiplayer experiences I have ever had. I even beta tested this and I want to say that the beta was better than the final product. The only game mode I haven't found to be broken is deathmatch.In Wanted, you're lucky to arrive in a lobby where people aren't just running around getting 100 pts per kill. Causing you to chase them wildly throughout the map because they never slow down for you to sneak up on them. Then your pursuer has no problem finding you and killing you.Artifact Assault is the most broken game mode because the game tells you not to be stealthy. Very few of the abilities allow you to steal the artifact stealthily and once you do you have to run anyways because the other team knows exactly where you are. How is that at all assassin like?Manhunt it's a team based game. Scratch that, all team based modes in this are terrible. Why? Because the team doesn't share XP. Manhunt basically pins you against your team mates to get the most kills. There is no effort to even encourage team work.Not to mention the servers seem to randomly go down for me. This is a terrible multiplayer experience. In conclusion I was very pleasantly surprised by this game, and purely bought it because Battlefield 4 was so broken and I wanted an open world next gen experience. I was not at all dissapointed by that other than the multiplayer which I think ubisoft should just drop in general or do the same thing they are doing in Watchdogs.. This is probably one of the better launch titles out right now and I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the series or a fan of pirates.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[One of the first videogames I ever played was about pirates. It starred a (not at all) fearless, insult-sword-fighting, unlucky scoundrel named Guybrush Threepwood whose only dream was to become a notorious pirate. A lot of other sea-worthy titles have come and gone since the Monkey Island series, but I have had a soft spot for the roguish, grog-swilling brigands of yore since I first battled LeChuck all those years ago.Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag shares almost nothing but the setting with the great Monkey Island franchise, but it does allow the player to fulfill Guybrush’s dream of becoming a notorious pirate.In Black Flag, you become an employee of Abstergo Entertainment, a fictional game developer that serves as a Templar cover for locating artifacts lost to their historical rivals, the Assassins.Desmond Miles, the modern-day protagonist of previous Assassin’s Creed titles, is once again the genetic base for Abstergo’s Animus project – essentially a device that uses DNA to view the past through ancestry – and the player digs through his genes to access Desmond’s ancestor’s life with the aim of creating a game about pirates.When inside the Animus, the player becomes Edward Kenway, a Welsh privateer-turned-pirate in the 1700′s. Kenway, grandfather of Assassin’s Creed III‘s Connor, becomes shipwrecked on an island and meets Duncan Walpole, a traitorous Assassin, who attempts to murder him. After defeating Walpole, Kenway finds a letter on Walpole’s corpse addressed to a group called the Templars promising a great amount of money.Edward dons Walpole’s Assassin garb and makes his way to the Templars, acting as if he were Walpole in the hopes of receiving the promised riches. Unknowingly, Edward has furthered the struggle between the two secret societies and given the Templars more power in the coming battle.By using a character clueless to the ancestral struggle as well as ending AC3 the way they did, Ubisoft allows for a (mostly) fresh start, and newcomers should be able to grasp the storyline relatively easily. Most background-related questions can be answered by browsing the extensive Animus Database or through dialogue in-game and so prior knowledge of the franchise is not a requirement for enjoyment – though there are several nods to the past (particularly in the modern sequences) that fresh Assassins might miss out on.The plot of Black Flag, while mostly serviceable, often feels schizophrenic. Ellipses muddle the timeline, offering a chronological but disjointed experience. In one instance, Edward seems to suddenly become self-reflective and thoughtful, which feels at odds with the character he was only minutes before.That being said, the story does have some excellent moments – some even touching and emotional – and manages to capture the essence of a pirate’s life both on land and at sea without falling into the cliché “Yarr matey!” business.While I was originally skeptical of the game developer aspect of ACIV, the conspiratorial overtones and nefarious ulterior motives of the company makes for an interesting aside to the main game. Implicating the player in Abstergo’s plans creates a more personal experience and toys with the idea that the game is much more than simple entertainment.Gameplay is largely the same as previous Assassin’s Creed entries, with an added refinement and focus on naval traversal and warfare. Kenway can climb, jump, run, and hide just as previous ancestors could, but the real fun comes from sailing your ship around the huge world Ubisoft has created.Acquiring a ship follows Kenway’s accidental infiltration of the Templars and subsequent misadventures. The Jackdaw – as Kenway names it – starts as a fragile, low damage-dealing gunship but through upgrades (and skill) can more than take on any other ship in the sea. These upgrades require resources, however, and the best way to build up your metal, wood, and cloth cache is to board other ships.Doing enough damage to an enemy vessel allows for Kenway’s crew to launch grapples and pull in for a closer assault. Different ships require various goals to result in a takeover, such as killing five to twenty crewmembers, destroying powder kegs, or cutting their flags down. By boarding, the player receives the full amount of resources the ship holds, whereas sinking them only gives up half of their total cargo.The boarding process can become tedious while searching for the tons of precious metal required for elite weapons, but is largely an enjoyable experience. Swinging from a rope on your ship to assassinate an enemy captain looks as stylish and cinematic as it sounds, and in my forty hours of game time, I only began to find it a chore near the end.To make traversal more streamlined, fast travel is accessible after visiting any location. A huge map with an enormous number of collectibles makes for a lot of sailing and fast travel saved me from slogging it out plenty of times.Some of the frustrations of previous AC games emerge once again here. “Tailing” missions are made even more awkward by using ships to follow others, with areas of awareness coming off of forts and enemy vessels. Another old problem rears its head in movement on land. I often found myself jumping to my death rather than to the next branch, ledge, or roof – though admittedly, it was less frequent than in previous titles.Combat can feel clumsy at times as well. Without a lock-on feature, Kenway attacks highlighted enemies, whether they are the closest to him or not. Counterattacking is generally responsive, but I occasionally found I was getting hit despite pressing the appropriate button. With a little refinement, the combat could be spot-on because when it works, it looks and feels great.The game’s visuals are stunning – whether in a bustling city, on a deserted island, or sailing through the stormy seas, it is clear that Ubisoft put a lot of work into details. Foliage responds to wind and movement, water splashes and rushes over your ship, and a nice assortment of villagers keeps towns feeling fresh.Due to a strong focus on sailing, players can expect to view the open sea frequently, and thanks to storms, wildlife, and a beautiful day/night cycle, I always had something interesting to look at.I suffered no frame rate issues or missing textures in my forty hours with the game, but I did once fall through the environment after getting stuck between a tree and a ledge. The problem sorted itself out with a death and respawn at my last checkpoint, however, and didn’t overly affect my experience.As they are apt to do, Ubisoft has crammed an enormous amount of content into this game. Side missions, colectibles, treasure maps, and animals to hunt and craft items from being just a few of the many activities present here.One of my favorite optional undertakings was exploring underwater shipwrecks. Kenway’s ship receives a diving bell later on in the story, allowing for deep sea treasure hunting. The shark-infested waters offer a short, rewarding alternative activity to the usual pirating, and with elite upgrade plans found in the wrecks, this activity is made all the more worth it.“Legendary” ships offer extreme challenges for those who seek more difficulty. One located in each corner of the map, these monstrous vessels boast incredible armor and firepower for the most dedicated pirates to attempt to battle. A huge monetary reward comes with destroying them, though, and it becomes worth it for both the coin and the glory.The “hide and seek with assassins” brand of multiplayer returns in Black Flag. Different game modes offer varied objectives but the concept remains the same. Players must blend with groups of AI characters to sneak up on unsuspecting opposing targets and pull off assassinations for points. It is great fun when both teams are playing “properly” but when players decide to go Rambo-style, it devolves into a frustrating deathmatch. Either way, it’s a great time-waster and will keep the disc in players’ drives or the file on their consoles.Ubisoft has released a companion app for iOS and Android users to engage in with Kenway’s Fleet, a ship-battling and cargo trading minigame. Also accessible in the Captain’s Quarters of the player’s ship, users can clear out trading paths and send ships acquired through boarding to gain collectibles, money, and treasure maps. The minigame encourages a social aspect in speeding up, healing, or escorting other players on your friend list’s ships. I found the companion app to be a great way to earn plenty of money while away from my console. The app is free and unintrusive, as well as very useful, and I highly recommend its use.I loaded up ACIV not expecting to find such a polished, fun experience, particularly after the dull mess I found last year’s title to be. By the time I watched the credits roll, I was once again a believer in the franchise. As it stands, this is the highest quality retail game available on PS4 and well worth anyone’s time and money.In playing Black Flag, I was finally able to realize the wish I shared with Guybrush Threepwood all those years ago – I finally became a notorious pirate (from the comfort and safety of my living room).Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some insult-sword-fighting practice to attend to.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[I'm not a big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise. I only played 2 previously, and while I had some good times, I didn't finish it and obviously didn't play anything between then and now. So, if you're a devotee of the series, this review isn't for you. However, if you're more like me and were interested in seeing whether this franchise has matured with age, I would say that the answer is mostly no. And if you're here because while being an assassin doesn't sound like much fun, being a pirate does, I would say the answer is a more of a conditional yes.First and foremost, AC IV is still an Assassin's Creed game first and foremost. You still go on contracts, you still feel vaguely as if you've broken the game every time you end up using swords instead of your wrist blades and have to kill everyone with relative ease (if the game hasn't given you a tail mission and doing so represents an automatic fail state), and you still have to deal with Templar/Assassin mumbo jumbo that's founded on some moral edifice that I've never quite been able to hold onto. You'll even still occasionally be taken out of history into your modern-day self in a sequence that isn't quite as intrusive as in the past (admittedly, this is based mostly on hearsay) but which contains a bunch of optional content that I have to imagine is only of interest to people who are more caught up in the lore of it all. I don't think that this portion of the game has changed or improved at all over the course of four years.So really, the unknown factor in all this are the contributions that playing as a pirate brings, and this obviously comes as a huge break from the series' past. In tone, it does manage to be a bit lighter, and the rendition of the sea is beautiful.  Occasionally, as during a storm, sailing manages to be an engaging experience all by itself. However, when you boil it down to its gameplay essence, being a pirate ultimately boils down to one of three things: attacking and boarding ships, whaling, and underwater wreckage. Of the three, only the last manages not to become repetitive by the end of the game, and I don't believe the second was any fun to begin with. My experience with pirating was that for awhile I got caught up in the upgrade loop that slowly led me to turning my modest brig into a weapon capable of bringing down the largest galleons, but once I had reached that apex, I realized that I was still doing the same things I'd been doing since the beginning of the game, with only the slightest changes in mechanics to reward me.In essence, I realize this all comes across as very critical, but I really couldn't give this game a score lower than I did. It looks good and controls well, and an intensive amount of effort went into giving the game substantial and varied content to keep the player entertained. And it did so for me to the tune of 20 hours, with only minimal frustration, though I was quite ready for it to be over when I finally finished. But at the end of the day, the main thing I came away with from ACIV was that no matter how you dress it up, I am not the audience for the Assassin's Creed franchise. I have to imagine that anyone who really saw magic in the AC formula in previous installments would come away much happier with the game than I did.Now if someone wants to devote a bit more time and detail to being a pirate, on the other hand...]]>"

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[ Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag is a game where pirating and assassin...ing?? blend perfectly. So it all starts with the lowly Edward Kenway possibly struggling as an alcoholic of sorts, tho there is no clear indicator. Edward wants to sail the high seas and become something while his spouse wants him to stay home and remain working. Edward shows true signs of his love to her. Touching. Edward no longer feels a poor life is for him. And he is off like that. A shipwreck and island crawl later Edward has killed a real assassin and taken his gear along with his belongings. A small glass cube and a letter sending him to Havanna. The story line was great so far, everything made sense and was laid out easily. Almost anyone with an interest in the game could pick it up and play. As for myself, I have always been interested in stealth games. The game just worked. Throughout Havanna are assassination contracts, shanties, animus fragments, and leaps of faith. All of the large scale cities have this as well but Havanna is massive. Good, great, grand, wonderful. Now back to my experience. Again the story was great so far. So far. I met some guy, went to this place and that and sooner than later Edward, a pirate and practically assassin, is standing right next to three other NPC ""enemies"" discussing the Observatory. After completing that shit I happily started betraying, killing, sneaking, jumping, falling, and finally got my own damn ship. Edward clearly has no concern for a while about home or his wife and he just does what ever he damn-well pleases. The foot missions become a bit repetitive at this point. Still the game had me drawn in entirely. I feel that the division of ship battles/sailing and foot missions are what makes you want to keep playing. It worked on me. Overall the game is beautiful in every corner you may peek. Your character movements look great. Battles are more intense than I had expected. The game has the ability to hit you in feels every now and then. 4 out of 5 stars for sure. GRIPE: Office missions are a sonofabitch.Thanks for reading.-Guacadile]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[I applaud any video game that reaches franchise status. It’s a difficult task in today’s video game market to create something fresh and turn a profit (ask Curt Schilling’s 38 Studios about this) at the same time. Franchises, such as Gears of War, Halo, and even Call of Duty have constantly redefined their respective genres, pushing graphical and gameplay boundaries at each iteration. Yet I chose these three games for a reason: their products have fallen flat.Gearheads like me found Judgment's storyline and level design to be too compartmentalized. Halo 4 was a transitional piece developed by 343 who feared of alienating Bungie’s fans by playing it safe. And even with the amazing dog and fish artificial intelligence displayed during Xbox One’s press conference, Call of Duty: Ghosts seemed like more of the tired gameplay. If you don’t believe me about Gears or Halo, check out the latest Xbox Live gameplay metrics from Major Nelson, or run a quick comparison of the dwindling Metacritic scores.Innovation is what is desperately needed. Luckily, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag has this in spades. Before I deep dive into specifics, there are two features that really stood out to me which lets me know that Ubisoft listened to our complaints about Assassin’s Creed III. The first is that gameplay just starts. Tutorials are extremely streamlined. Within two minutes of starting up the game, you’re already involved in a high speed footrace through a beautifully rendered jungle environment. The second are the “comment cards” at the end of each mission. Purely optional, you can provide feedback on what you just played. Short of developing the game as you played it, I must say Ubisoft is really trying to win back fans after Assassin’s Creed III.In case you couldn’t already tell, I love this game. I decided to wait for the PlayStation 4 version, which has minimal graphical improvements over the PlayStation 3 / Xbox 360 versions. Most noticeably to me is the amazing detail to water. If you’re like me, you’ll be spending a majority of your time sailing the high seas in search of deserted islands full of loot or entrenched in glorious sea battles. The attention to little details, such as individual drops of rain during a downpour, or the subtle splashing of waves against the bow are real stand outs in this version. Unfortunately, draw distance does suffer slightly, but by no fault of the PlayStation 4. Ships slowly phase in to eyesight, a byproduct of utilizing the same gaming engine between both older and newer platforms. This doesn’t affect core gameplay but is noticeable when you’re sailing amongst the high seas and a ship suddenly phases into eyesight some 1,500 meters away. It’s disappointing that the Ubisoft crew couldn’t address this.Ubisoft took the idea of The Frontier, the massive sandbox which Connor explored in Assassin’s Creed III, and took that idea to an even greater level: open world gameplay. While there are some special sections of the game which load independently (major cities, such as Nassau), a great majority of the game is seamless. That means a typical gaming session start by hunting exotic animals for crafting materials on a deserted island to freeing prisoners to naval battles to ship boarding, all without a loading screen. This type of freedom is rarely seen outside of Grand Theft Auto titles, and is a welcome addition to the Assassin’s Creed universe.Besides the main storyline, there are naval and assassination contracts to be completed, treasure chests and maps (based on global latitude and longitude for starting coordinates), shark and whale harpooning mini games, underwater exploration, clothing and weapon crafting, and even ship upgrades. Although most exploration yields money and material for upgrades, there are the occasional “epic plans” which provide top tier rewards. Exploration is rewarded, and no matter which direction you choose to go in, progression feels rewarding. It’s a smart system that has been perfected elsewhere and is finally gaining traction in Assassin’s Creed. Couple this with the great climbing and combat mechanics and you have a title that feels much more fleshed out than its predecessors.Unfortunately, there are some elements of this game that come up short. Many of the problems that plagued Assassin’s Creed III remain prevalent. Edward can assassinate people via the hidden wrist blade before he has it. Guns and other stolen enemy weapons still get stuck and float aimlessly in mid-air when climbing. Unnecessary clipping is prevalent, especially climbing around the Jackdaw’s numerous sails and pulleys. These are all polishing issues, and by now, Ubisoft should have sorted these out. But none of them really impact the overall experience.Oh, and although I think I’m in the minority here, but I loved the entire Animus/Desmond mystery. But fear not, for the entire Animus/Abstergo angle is almost entirely optional. You play as a nameless, faceless and voiceless Abstergo employee whose job is to fine tune the upcoming pirate vacation simulator. Of course, should you choose to snoop around the office, you’ll never know what you find...The most frustrating thing about the game, perhaps, is that the overall plot seems incomplete. Edward Kenway leaves his family in search of fortune. Not revenge, not a piece of Eden, or establishing The Order… only money. What makes this goal odd is that the amount he actually requires doesn't seem to matter. By the time I left the first island, doing my usual “grab every chest and loot every corpse” routine I had a little over 8,500 reals. What is the major payday after the first mission? It’s a paltry 1,000 reals. Although Edward makes a comment that the amount isn’t enough to retire, there is no “get enough money to go home” quest. In fact, I spent so long plundering the high seas I was near to 100K reals at one point. I ended up dumping them all into the Jackdaw and upgrades, but nowhere did I get the sense that I was close to getting Edward home. The arbitrary “I need more money goal” is sloppy.Overall, this game is not perfect. But in my opinion it’s the greatest Assassin’s Creed game to date (sorry Ezio!). I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike. It’s a great peak into what truly next generation, open world gameplay is all about.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag from Ubisoft improves upon many of the mechanics of 3 while not addressing much of the series' overall narrative. While the gameplay is some of the best in the series, the story just seems to tread water. For more, check out my Video Review.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[Having been a long time Assassin's Creed fan, even I have to admit that Assassin's Creed 3 took the wind out of my sails. There was a part of me at peace with the fact that the franchise was past it's best and that was okay, after all some of my favorite games of the past generation were Assassin's Creed games. It's with that in mind that I took barely any notice of Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag since it's announcement. Whereas once I was on forums debating every little detail and trying to answer every mystery the games once hinted at, I found myself just not at all interested. But maybe that was in my favor.Meet Edward Kenway, and a few of his colorful cast of friends.Black Flag primarily takes place in the 1700's Caribbean. Whilst I don't wish to spoil many of the games intriguing twists and turns the main tale is told of Edward Kenway (yes, father of Haytham and grandfather to Connor). Whose dream of riches and adventure take him to the sunny shores of the Caribbean in search for the ultimate prize. Like past Assassin's Creed games it's the story which truly drives the adventure here and it's helped by Edward whose such a likable character. Edward is a very different figure to those we've seen before, less driven by beliefs and more driven by simple greed. However there are layers to Edward that are wonderfully touched on throughout his story and unlike Connor, he's a difficult man to dislike and feels like a more fleshed out and complex character to Connor hard outer shell which turned many off the Assassin's Creed 3 protagonist.The Caribbean is gorgeous to traverse, be it at sea or land.Much of what makes Black Flag such an enjoyable game comes down to a mix of better balanced mechanics and a world which is as detailed and intriguing as the story it tells. The Caribbean looks stunning, from the sunlit seas to the vast detailed cities that scatter the map. There's a general level of detail to the sound throughout Black Flag to, which helps sells this world from the crashing of the waves to the chatter of civilians, not to mention the superb sea chants sung by your ships crew. That's right, ship combat returns but on another level entirely as your ship is now your primary means of transport. Whilst this might sound tedious to some, ship traversal is one of Black Flag's most enjoyable features and you'll soon find yourself singing along with your crew as glide your ship the Jackdaw peacefully across the calm seas of the beautiful Caribbean. It might sound simple, but there's a real joy to be found in traversing this world by sea. Once you've visited one of the many locations scattered around the map, a quick travel system is offered for those who don't wish to travel by ship all too often. That said, ship combat plays a large part of Black Flag and to upgrade your ship you'll have to pirate vessels of all kinds to earn bounty enough for the most required upgrades. It's a system that can begin to feel repetitive as you board ship after ship, but the greater variation in what you can do throughout the world make this less of an issue.Ship combat returns and it's never been better. Resulting in some captivating moments throughout.One of the most striking differences between Black Flag and Assassin's Creed 3 is a simple one, it's just a hell of a lot more fun to play. I'm not sure if it's mechanics being re-balanced or better game design in general, but Black Flag feels like a welcome return to the likes of Brotherhood where you were eager for the next stealth section because it no longer drives you up the wall or leave you frustrated. Whereas AC3 suffered with gameplay sections that either felt unfair or frustrating, the gameplay in Black Flag feels fairer which results in a more much enjoyable experience. Only at a few points did I get frustrated with what the game was asking of me or find that the mechanics were obstructing my way. Most importantly of all is the fact that Black Flag makes you feel like a badass assassin again and in my opinion that's what makes an Assassin's Creed game great in the first place.There's a great deal on offer in Assassin's Creed 4: Blag Flag, it's a pretty substantial game. From the lengthy single player campaign to multiplayer offerings, you'll find yourself satisfied for a good while, even if multiplayer will still only appeal to those interested in it's format. But what makes Black Flag stand out more than anything is the simple fact that it's the best Assassin's Creed game since Brotherhood graced us. There's a feeling that the franchise might be back on track after all and the intriguing story leaves many options open for the future games. Long time fans will appreciate the detail Ubisoft have gone into when it comes to the lore of the these games while new players will appreciate what is a great playing game in a rich and detailed world. There are a few niggling issues that still affect the franchise, but when you've been as pleasantly surprised as I have, these issues are easier to ignore and certainly don't rock the boat. So I'll stop with the boat jokes and tell you simply, that Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is a must play for all. Ahoy captain! ]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[Hands up if you’ve grown tired of the Assassin’s Creed franchise over the past few years. There’s probably a lot of you.After progressive sequels in the shape of Assassin’s Creed II and Brotherhood, the yearly cycle of historical hood-wearing and neck stabbing began to grow stale. Revelations didn’t introduce the kind of refreshing changes seen in the previous two sequels and Assassin’s Creed III was a dull, glitchy disappointment despite the occasional thrill. This felt like a series in freefall, beginning an annualised path to mediocrity whilst its popularity remained intact.Edward is more Ezio than Connor. ThankfullySo it comes with unexpected elation that Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag refuses to continue the downward spiral many expected it to. In taking the best part of Assassin’s Creed III (naval combat) and building an entire game around it, Ubisoft Montreal have surpassed expectations with one of the most entertaining games in the series.With Desmond Miles’ story wrapped up in turgid fashion at the end of AC III you get the feeling that the development team were given the freedom to do as they please. This shows in Black Flag’s offbeat modern-day sections as you’re cast in the role of a silent, un-named employee of Abstergo Entertainment, the videogame development arm of the Templars’ evil corporation. As you tour their Montreal studio for the first time you might recognise a few familiar faces on the walls, while your employee handbook reveals some interesting titbits such as their development of Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation and some ties with a certain Ubisoft.It’s just the right amount of absurdity to get behind, particularly after Desmond’s solemn tale failed to live up to its early potential. Plus, it puts you right back into the Animus as you’re tasked with sifting through the memories of another of Desmond’s ancestors to research Abstergo’s next great pirate game. Of course, things are slightly more nefarious than that and you’ll spend the majority of your modern-day time interacting with shady characters and hacking into your co-workers computers for some expository infodumps that fill in the events of the past year. It’s essentially a collection of mini-games with some interesting story beats thrown in towards the end, but this only amounts to a fraction of your playtime so it doesn’t get in the way.The majority of your time will be spent on the seas and islands that make up the Caribbean. You play as Edward Kenway, a protagonist with a devil-may-care attitude more in-line with series favourite Ezio Auditore than anyone else – which is fitting for an adventure about swashbuckling privateers.There are jumping neck-stabs aplentyHis affiliation with the Assassins is refreshing tenuous, reflecting the attitude of the player at this point. Kenway begins the game assuming the identity of a traitor Assassin after they’re both shipwrecked following an explosive naval battle. This Assassin had been working with the Templars to track down a mysterious structure known as The Observatory, meant to house powerful technology both sides are vying for. Edward cares little about this, viewing the ancient structure as a treasure to be plundered to increase his minimal renown with untold glory and ample riches. All with the hopes of winning back his estranged wife, of course.It’s a different approach for the series and its protagonists, but one that mostly succeeds. Edward is still on the periphery for much of the narrative as it focuses on key historical events, but you wouldn’t have it any other way. His character arc is engaging by itself, with a satisfying and surprisingly poignant payoff, while his interactions with the diverse cast of enemies, friends and betrayers results in some of the series’ greatest moments. Black Flagcontinues the series’ knack of humanizing historical legends: you witness the ingenuity of the fearsome Blackbeard, explore the motives behind the pirate-turned-pirate-hunter Benjamin Hornigold and meet both Anne Bonny and Mary Read, the two most infamous female pirates of the era. It’s fantastic stuff.Unfortunately the same cannot be said once you set foot on land, although a few core series mechanics have been refined. There’s a greater emphasis on stealth, with most sneaking accomplished by dashing between vegetation and foliage. It’s an inelegant method but at least it’s more consistent than it was inAC III, despite how oblivious it makes enemies look. Stealth is rarely required in interesting situations though. Black Flag opts for the “follow mission” far too often, usually in service of an exposition dump as you eavesdrop on myriad conversations. It was a tired design in the very first Assassin’s Creed, but now it feels like mindless second nature.Elsewhere, platforming is as good as it’s ever been, the verticality of large cities like Havana providing the means to scale numerous man-made structures, while smaller islands present vast forests, ancient Mayan ruins and dangerous cliff faces to clamber across in typically fluid fashion. There’s a lot of diversity in how you navigate the world, while combat is also much the same, focusing on counters and parries with slick animation and brutal kills thrown in for good measure. It’s still serviceable but lacks any sort of challenge and is in need of a redesign for any future instalments.Few gaming moments in 2013 can beat sailing into the heart of a ferocious stormSo far, so Assassin’s Creed then. Where Black Flag differentiates itself is in its open-world sailing. This works much in the same way as it did in AC III, albeit on a larger scale. The map is huge with swathes of sea littered with a smattering of uninhabited islands, ports, sunken ships and enemy forts, along with the three larger cities. From the offset you can theoretically travel unimpeded, participating in various activities, from ship combat to underwater diving and even a spot of whaling. The only thing stopping you travelling where you please is the strength of enemy ships, forcing you to upgrade your own vessel (The Jackdaw) so you can venture further as it grows stronger.When you encounter other ships you can use your spyglass to see how powerful they are and get a good look at their precious cargo, weighing up the risk and reward of engaging in battle. If you do decide to unleash the full complement of cannon fire, long-range mortars and fire barrels at your disposal, you’ll discover the thrilling naval combat as you attempt to outmanoeuvre and outgun your adversary. The controls are straightforward yet you can employ many tactics to position your ship and deploy a deluge of heavy weaponry to cripple your foes in a hail of white smoke and energetic cheers from your crew.From here it’s time to plunder, boarding the incapacitated ship with a clash of swords and a seamless transition from one set of mechanics to another. Once you’ve worn down the crew and forced them to surrender, the cargo is yours, its materials used to upgrade the Jackdaw with an improved hull, more powerful broadside cannons and so on. You’re suitably rewarded for your efforts in a way AC III refused to do. While that game’s activities were bountiful, there were few tangible rewards for completing them and little reason to do them as a result. Black Flag fixes this, populating its world with a similar abbundance of side-quests but giving you plenty of reasons to do them.Of course there's rumYou’ll hunt great white sharks and humpback whales to craft ammo pouches and better armour. You’ll go off in search of Templars for the keys they carry to open a locked safe housing a unique outfit, or track down buried treasure using a crudely drawn map. You might travel to a far-flung island to sneak into a warehouse and steal the materials needed to buy your next mortar upgrade, or chase down shanties because you love how your crew sings as you set sail on another adventure. It’s a vibrant world with many striking sights to seek but it also rewards you with meaningful stuff when you get there. There’s a fantastic sense of discovery, capturing the thrill of sailing the open sea and its limitless possibilities.Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is an ambitious game. It may stagnate in spots with an over-reliance on dreary eavesdropping missions, simple combat mechanics and multiplayer with no substantial additions, yet none of that seems to matter when you’re in the heart of a treacherous storm, rain and wind lashing down upon the crew of the Jackdaw as you fight to avoid the frightening pull of a nearby twister. There’s so much to see and do, with a vibrant world just begging to be explored, daring seafaring antics and a welcome cohesion between all of its parts. It’s difficult to imagine Assassin’s Creed ever leaving the sea behind.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[I love open world games and this game could have been so much more, but instead you get a game that could have been much shorter. You end up repeating same things over and over and over. A bunch of FedEx (retrieval) and hoarding missions that all have the same cut scenes, objectives and even the same maps in some cases. If have the chance to buy...pass. Or least don't spend $60 on it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[I'm in an unusual position here, reviewing a game that was regarded highly at the time but presently sits between two iterations in the long-running and long-in-the-tooth Assassin's Creed franchise that were very poorly received indeed, making Black Flag something of an aberration in retrospect. While I believe to some extent that all games should be reviewed in a vacuum, based entirely on their own merits and their own weaknesses bereft of outside factors, it's often hard to escape the grander picture that surrounds them. Whether that's addressing the real-life sociopolitical reservations that might concern a game around its time of release, something that the upcoming FPS violent cop simulator Battlefield: Hardline is going to have a heck of time grappling with, or simply determining its place in an increasingly bloated pantheon of similarly structured assassinate 'em ups, these factors are not something that can easily be tiptoed around, nor hidden from via a convenient haystack. No game is an island, after all, though this one has plenty of islands in it.The truth is, while Black Flag is a far better product than AC III and AC: Unity in many respects, it's very much of the same caliber overall. The Anvil engine used by Assassin's Creed, appropriately-named given its immovability, gets minor tweaks with each new game, but it's clear from the many glitches and bugs that manage to persist from one version to the next that it's not getting the full overhaul it desperately needs any time soon. Since Brotherhood, we've had to deal with less than fluid ""automatic"" free-running, the ludicrously spasmodic enemy ragdolls, the many bizarre glitches that range from minor visual snafus to game-breaking AI issues. It's an engine that's been feeling its age for a while now, and having every new game introduce even more systems and features to heap on top of it only forces it to buckle more.However, the technical flubs pale in comparison with the mechanical. A somewhat cheeky little feature that the game introduces is a feedback system for story missions, allowing the player to confer a one-to-five point score to the sequence they just concluded. Questions were raised at the time as to whether or not this feedback would ever actually be acknowledged by Ubisoft developers (given Unity's reception, I would guess not), but I took the liberty of automatically rating one star any mission that involved the following: eavesdropping, tailing and/or a chase. Turns out approximately one in four missions did, looking back over the rankings on my completed save game file. Before I can explain why this is an issue, we must first establish why these three mission types in particular are so reviled.Assassin's Creed is at its best when the game presents a target, whether that's a person that needs killing or an item that needs burglarizing, and lets the player ascertain their own path to the goal. Many of the assassination side-activities are like this, presenting a small area filled with guards and challenging players with finding the best way to get to the target, preferably remaining undetected throughout, and remove them before they're spooked by the player's presence and escape. The player is free to be as cautious and patient as they wish, opting to hide and observe guard patrols before quietly choosing their moment to strike, or to impatiently start tossing around smoke grenades and sleep darts and leaping in for the kill before the target knows what's going on. The point is, the player has agency when it comes to the game's pace in all these scenarios. Eavesdropping and tailing missions are incredibly slow, serve little purpose beyond getting to hear the bad guy's predictable plans, always lead to an equally predictable location (which, hey, guess what, is usually a well-fortified position covered in the usual red ""this is a prohibited area"" filter on the mini-map) and, most critically, remove this player agency by forcing them to adhere to the mission's glacial pace. What's worse is that every eavesdropping mission has the player's targets wandering around in circles walking and talking like frickin' Aaron Sorkin characters. I was genuinely shocked none of them ever said, ""Hey, don't talk to me like I'm other Templars"". The original Assassin's Creed, though it had its own myriad problems with repetitive mission design, had you locate a primo spot to listen in on two characters who actually stayed put, like regular people do when conversing. We got no variation of that here, instead forcing players to switch hiding places constantly to remain within a moving cone of easy listening distance while they patiently wait for the game to let them play at their own speed again. Tailing is the same only worse, because the target would constantly stop dead in their tracks to paranoiacally look around, an obstacle that wasn't grating because it suddenly forced you to find cover, but because it needlessly extended what was already a tiresome waiting game. The chases are an entirely different (but still every bit as exasperating) kettle of fish, which ties in to what I was saying earlier about the game's less than stellar predictive auto-free-running system, where holding the R1 button was often an exercise in forlorn hope that your character wouldn't, in mid-sprint, suddenly decide to start climbing up the side of a nearby building because you cut a corner too tight in your pursuit.Also counterproductive to this open-world approach is the full synchronization bonus. Introduced in AC: Revelations, the full sync requirements--additional secondary tasks that the game asks you to perform, with the tacit understanding that this is how the sequence historically went down--were more or less the beginning of the end for Assassin's Creed's greatest strengths, i.e. player agency and mission versatility. While entirely optional, any 100%-aspirant is forced to adhere to a very strict and specific means to achieve their goals, often using weapons or tools or a strategy that runs perpendicular to their usual preferences. There's nothing wrong with being cajoled out of one's comfort zone now and again, as it can be the best way to find a new favorite method of performing assassinations (the overpowered berserk darts, for instance, tend to be overlooked by many), but it's still an unwelcome system that doesn't reward creativity in the player's approach so much as stifle it by telling them exactly how they should act. Somehow, Black Flag has found a way to make these full synchronization requirements even more obnoxious, by flat-out refusing to surface this information to the player in any conveniently transparent manner. The only way to tell if there's a full synchronization condition to pursue is by regularly pausing the game whenever a new stage of the mission is introduced, otherwise it's extremely likely that the first time you'll discover a full sync condition will be after the mission is over and the game skips over it, tut-tutting at your lack of thoroughness.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag isn't all doom and gloom, however. It has a very attractive setting, as the player jaunts around the picturesque and brightly colorful 18th century Caribbean in their modified brig ""the Jackdaw"", and the story and characters are far superior to anything found in Assassin's Creed III. Edward Kenway, our protagonist, is a deeply flawed hero who suffers from various delusions of grandeur due in part to marrying far above his station in a time period where such things mattered, chasing power, women and wealth because he feels he is owed them for whatever reason. On a whim, he chases down and murders a turncoat Assassin after a pirate hijacking gone awry and dons his apparel in order to profit from his apparent serendipity. He thus gets embroiled in the centuries-old Assassins versus Templars struggle entirely incidentally, spending the majority of the game seeking the Templar's target of a First Civilization device capable of spying on any human being on the planet. Rather than use it to control the various empires of the world, like the Templars are intending, he sees it as a means to earn the power and wealth he deserves. It takes a lot of character development and some well-defined secondary characters, like the conscientious young buccaneer James Kidd and Edward's ex-slave confidante and quartermaster Adéwale, to help him finally see the light. The game also does an all-stops tour of who's who in 1710s piracy, involving interactions with the likes of Ed ""Blackbeard"" Thatch, Stede Bonnet, Charles Vane, Anne Bonny, Ben Hornigold, Jack Rackham and Black Bart Roberts. Unlike the Forrest Gump-esque insertions of famous American Revolution figures in AC III, these famous pirate figures are far better fleshed out and given personalities and motives that help to shed light on their decision to turn to plundering and larceny on the high seas.Likewise, the game's modern framing device has moved from the travails of the milquetoast Desmond Miles and his modern-day Assassin compatriots to a video game development company operated by sinister Templar bigwigs Abstergo that puts the player in the sneakers of an anonymous employee working through Edward's memories so they can be adapted into a lucrative ""virtual experience"" property. The brief sequences with this character are somewhat entertaining too, and the source of the game's many self-deprecating meta gags regarding the faults of the Assassin's Creed franchise, especially its deleterious annual turnaround and its laissez-faire approach to anachronisms and historical accuracy (though it feels somewhat cynical as well, given how none of these faults are ever addressed beyond pithy ""yeah, we suck"" meta commentary).The game also has a few positive additions to the game's beleagured engine, though each has its own negative side as well. The deep sea diving is an entertaining means of procuring extra cash and upgrade plans for the Jackdaw, picking over sunken wrecks for treasures while avoiding the hostile sealife, though this essentially equates to long continuous underwater missions with the requisite untenable underwater swimming controls and oxygen meters. Likewise, the new ""Kenway's Fleet"" mini-game that replaces the usual Assassin deployments across the world features some appealing if perfunctory turn-based strategic ship combat as well as a means of making even more money and resources in the background as the player continues the main game, but is hamstrung by obnoxious enforced waiting periods that are sometimes as long as 36 real-time hours; a system apparently purloined from all those obnoxious freemium iPhone games.The improved setting and story greatly ameliorate the problems Assassin's Creed has been suffering for multiple iterations now, but doesn't come close to absolving them entirely. Black Flag is another entry in the same technically broken, mechanically stagnant and functionally identical series Assassin's Creed has been for years, and no amount of funtime pirate adventures can gloss that over.]]>"

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[The annual release model is an understandably maligned approach to sculpting game franchises, but it’s odd that Assassin’s Creed in particular became one of those big AAA games we expect to see a new edition of every year. It makes sense for Ubisoft of course, Assassin’s Creed is possibly the most beloved of all their game series, but think about this game in relation to something like Call of Duty, the other big annual action title. Many people don’t even buy CoD for its single-player, they just play the multiplayer which is there for as much or as little time as they want to commit to it, and then they can just put it aside and wait for next year’s entry. Even if they do play through the main campaign it’s linearly structured and a short to medium length. Assassin’s Creed however is built with a lengthy story mode as its main attraction and invites you off on journeys to participate in an insane quantity of collectible hunts, side missions, and now even multiplayer face-offs. The idea that Ubisoft might want or expect us to come back every single year and dance that same dance, soaking in tens of hours of content, is a bit overwhelming, but Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag stands out for me as a welcome oasis of originality and delight in a desert of games which has increasingly asked you to dedicate huge chunks of your time to games of mixed quality.Black Flag's new setting brings a new flavour.You see, Assassin’s Creed is a game built mostly around environmental traversal, urban platforming, and combat within those contexts, but Black Flag finds itself in the midst of the notorious piracy of the late 17th century-early 18th century Caribbean. Cast out to sea where it can only partly fall back on the cityscape action and nature-based platforming of its predecessors, the series is forced to build greatly on some of the most original concepts of the recent games and invent entirely new mechanics to fill its shining, azure oceans. As in previous games AC IV encases its alternate history fiction within a larger meta-narrative, although never has the series committed to it quite so confidently as it does here. You play a fresh-faced employee of “Abstergo Entertainment”, who are actually the insidious Templars of previous games searching the ancestral lineage of the all-important Desmond Miles under the guise that they’re developing a series of video games that basically are the Assassin’s Creed series. The memories you search through are that of Edward Kenway, a foolhardy man who dreamt of finding freedom and countless riches as a sailor, but became caught up in a tussle between the ancient orders of the Assassins and the Templars over The Observatory, a theoretical device which lets its user see the actions and location of any person in the world.One unique thing to note about Black Flag upfront is how sharply it divides its gameplay between land and sea. Most on-land locations are instanced sections of seafront town or jungle, although the map also has plenty of small deserted islands dotted about for good measure. What you experience in these locations is more or less what you know from Assassin’s Creed, and its a testament to how knowingly crafted the game is that the large majority of this fare still holds. Thoughtfully designed level layouts combine with strong pacing and the series’ intuitive stealth and combat mechanics to make you feel like a shadowy force to be reckoned with. While Black Flag’s predecessor, Assassin’s Creed III, was generally received with disappointment, it is clear here how important some of its contributions are to the formula. Being able to conceal yourself from enemies in the world’s abundant foliage lets you move between hiding spots more fluidly than in the older games and while having secondary objectives might at first seem like another result of Ubisoft’s occasional proclivity for kitchen sink design, it often now makes it feel like discreetness and mastery of your tools is properly rewarded. It’s also worth noting just how good it still feels to assassinate someone in these games. It’s a great example of design, sound, and animation all flowing aptly and smoothly together to deliver an iconic and satisfying moment, and knock outs and sword kills come from a similar place. The fun to be had here does have its limits however.Everything you associate with Assassin's Creed is still here, for better or worse.This Assassin’s Creed game, perhaps more than any of the others, feels like it takes a while to get going, and that’s largely because while tightly refined by this point, the standard gameplay is something we all know front to back by now. A small amount of the shine is also wiped away by the mechanical melting pot that Ubisoft are indulging their AAA games as a whole in. This is definitely not the only recent Ubisoft release where, for example, you have to climb to the top of towers to uncover areas of the map, or kill and skin animals to upgrade your armour and ammo pouches. There is fortunately the option to buy the materials you can otherwise only get from harvesting animals to upgrade your equipment, although when you can just economically brute force your way through the system, it does start to suggest that the development team knew they were making a set of challenges that a significant amount of their audience wouldn’t be interested in. While more tolerable than before, the missions in which you’re just meant to stalk characters until they reach their destination do also start to grate after a while. No one of these problems is huge, and collectively they’re not big enough to eclipse the positives of the gameplay, but they’re just enough together to be difficult to ignore.What really makes the game feel as new and varied as it does is the sailing and sea combat. The fast-travel system is still there to get you to places you’ve already been, but for many missions and to reach new locations it’s necessary to sail your grand ship, the Jackdaw, across the welcoming surf of the Caribbean. The sailing continues the series’ tradition of providing an engaging experience by making even the basic mechanics you use to get from A to B exciting to interact with, and is an essential part of perhaps the thing that the game gets most right: It’s not just an Assassin’s Creed title with a couple of Jolly Rogers hanging off of it, it commits in a more base way to feeling like a game about piracy. You see it in on the large scale with how much of the game you spend behind a helm, sailing towards adventure, you see it in the smaller details like the spray washing over the deck of your ship, and you see it somewhere in between with challenges and opportunities like being able to navigate your vessel through treacherous storms. A wonderful little addition is having sea shanties be collectibles which you can obtain while on land and which your crew will then sing on your voyages. Then there’s the ship-based combat which is not just enjoyable for what it is in itself, but also for the place it takes in the larger picture.The sea voyages and battles contain some of the most visually stunning moments.When simply roaming the open-world in Assassin’s Creed, combat encounters are rarely events you feel motivated to seek out yourself. They’re usually the consequence of accidentally running into a group of angry guards instead of being something you’re eager to initiate because they convey any kind of reward, but this is not the case with battle aboard the Jackdaw. The game is generally smart about resources. While many other AAA games have you overflowing with money by a certain point so you don’t feel like you are ever obligated to perform side activites, Black Flag makes sure that if you want all those shiny new items you earn your keep, and that’s never truer than when out on the oceans. The increasing difficulty of the missions means that upgrading your ship over the course of the game is a necessity, however it can only be upgraded using the wood, iron, and cloth you can raid from other ships. It gives you an incentive to not just go out and storm vessels, but to equally as importantly do it under your own volition, which is a big part of what makes you feel like a pirate. Similarly, there’s also a mini-game in which you can have your ships battle Navy forces and run cargo across the Atlantic which adds to this sense that you’re a great pirate captain, although playing with this mini-game for too long becomes tiresome as a less than perfect UI leaves you with far more scrolling through menus than is necessary.For the proper sea combat, the design quality is much higher. The air becomes heated and urgent because there are a lot of little moves you have to make with your ship which add up to something bigger. A dumber game might have just made the goal to line up your ship against your opponent’s and make broadside attacks over and over, but ships are bulky and don’t have a huge deal of maneuverability, meaning that those kinds of battles often have large gulfs of time where you’re doing nothing more interesting than turning around. The combat here isn’t just about positioning and using your main cannons, you can also rain fire down on your enemies with your mortar, adjust your speed, drop fire barrels behind you, ram other ships, fire on their weak points with your swivel cannons, launch chain shots from the front of your ship, and more, and this all keeps things moving. The battles also build to not just the possible sinking of enemy ships, but if you want to really plunder them, jumping aboard and killing the enemy crew to take them for yourself. It means that at the conclusion of fights you don’t just hit a “The ship is beat now” screen, you get to take to the burning deck of the enemy schooners and brigs, and more closely play a part in forcing their surrender. The only real times the game doesn’t do right by this combat are during some occasional wrestling with the camera while fighting aboard ships and in the existence of the “restricted areas” out at sea. They’re most likely there to make it so that you can run into more battles in these dangerous expanses of the Caribbean, but the idea of navigating your way around ships with vision cones is silly. It’s unintuitive to try to precision captain the enormous Jackdaw through gaps in the line of sight of enemies, and this “ship stealth” element runs contrary to the sense of freedom the game is otherwise about. And that sense of freedom is all-important to the game.Kenway and his company better fit the attitude of the series.One of the strange things about Assassin’s Creed is that the Assassins as a group are concerned with order, discipline, and focus in their operations, meanwhile the gameplay is concerned with being forgiving and spontaneous. You don’t need monk-like discipline because even when you do fail to slip effortlessly by oblivious guards, you still have an out. You’re actively discouraged from being single-minded and focused, and instead nudged into deviating from your main responsibilities whenever you feel like it to entertain collectibles and side-missions. Kenway however, has no delusions of grandeur here. He’s not concerned with the enshrined values of ancient orders, he just wants to be a man unbound by rules and free to earn his gold, and that gels a lot better with a mechanical framework which lets you scale entire buildings and trip over yourself in fights but keep on going. Not to mention the way these sentiments line up with questing across the vast, open ocean.In general the roguish nature of Kenway makes him fun to play and it’s a bit like a childhood fantasy come to life to be able to pillage and plunder with the likes of Blackbeard and Mary Read. The game manages to bend the history just enough to give each of the historical figures an animated and magnetic personality while retaining various key events in their lives and a certain truth to them. It wouldn’t be an Assassin’s Creed story if it didn’t come apart at the seams somewhere along the line though. When I first saw them introducing the Ubisoft/Abstergo concept in the plot I was pleasantly surprised not only with how bold and funny this choice was, but also with how getting the more ridiculous elements of the story out in the open near the beginning should have helped avoid the almost deliberate whiplash the series likes to create by playing as a piece of alternate historical fiction for 98% of its runtime and then producing some borderline nonsensical sci-fi in its closing minutes for the sake of it. As it turns out however, there’s no underlying premise for a story so farfetched that Ubisoft can’t manage to make it look like the epitome of logic by the end of their game. There’s something vaguely interesting in how far they go with the twist at the end of this one, but it’s basically just the series utilising one of the most played-out sci-fi tropes there is with no meaningfully unique execution to do what it wants to do. Once again, one of the problems is that the series doesn’t lay enough groundwork leading up to its closing to make you care all that much about the consequences of anything that happens during it.It would be nice if Abstergo was as engaging as it is picturesque.That’s not to say they don’t try to build some sort of narrative path up to the end. There are, for example, various points in the single-player mode where your mission becomes to get up from your desk in the Abstergo building and wander the corporate complex on various tasks, but while it’s a very pretty office and the hacking mini-games you’re given play enjoyably enough, trundling about the place like an expedient roomba doesn’t compare to the enlivened sailing and platforming of play inside the Animus. It’s just plain bizarre that they’d couch this adventure of leaping from rooftops and blowing cannonball-shaped holes through enemy ranks in a setting which has you hanging around water coolers, listening to the banal speeches of your co-workers. What’s more, the protagonist is an emotionless mute, you can see the bad guys coming a mile off, and the characters who play instrumental parts in the story are vague wisps of people, they don’t really matter. I’ve seen the meta-story here praised for its tongue-in-cheek hilarity, but it actually feels like the game takes what starts as a good high concept joke and turns it into a meaningless super-plot purely because it’s something that could be done, not because it serves any firm purpose. Even concerning the in-Animus content, the game doesn’t really know how to end, to the point where a huge chunk of important exposition is explained out loud by a character over the credits, the events following on from a story thread that felt once relevant but was dropped somewhere around the end of the game’s first act. I mention the faults in the story not because any of them do disastrous damage to the game, but more because they’re interesting and a bit of a testament to how we tend to excuse shoddy writing in games as a medium. If you want to see the truly disastrous though, it’s here, and it lives in the multiplayer.When functional at a technical level, the multiplayer mode exhibits the same properties as it has ever since its introduction in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood. You end up playing for those delicious moments where you feel like you’re winning a truly psychological struggle against your opponents. It’s the thrill of being able to trick your enemies into thinking you’re something you’re not, right up until the second when what they thought was a computer-controlled crowd member slits their throat clean open, and I’m still not bored of that. It’s a take on multiplayer that you can’t get anywhere else and can be so intellectually empowering. As ever though, it’s undermined by the fact that your targets or pursuers may abandon their stealth mindset to sprint about the map, meaning you have to run about the level yourself to catch/avoid them, and then the other people involved with you probably have to do the same, and you sometimes see this domino effect which causes the stealth dynamic to drop out from the bottom. Then there are various abilities which can be utilised in this mode which seem to break the spirit of it. When your pursuers can just click a button to see who’s a real player and who’s not, and when certain abilities can only be countered on the off-chance that you happen to have certain other ones equipped, it feels less than fair. All of this I’ve tolerated in the past. It’s frustrating and it ruins matches, but often I pushed through because of how good the multiplayer was when it was good. This time however, I encountered technical issues that pushed my patience beyond the realm of the reasonable.To call the multiplayer experience ""bittersweet"" would be too kind.It wasn’t the faults with the menus, which went so far that on two occasions I had to reset the game to make them functional. It wasn’t even the three times the multiplayer crashed to desktop with no explanation why. Instead it was the game’s inability to find, connect to, and stay connected to multiplayer matches. Reports of connection issues similar to the ones I had aren’t exactly rampant, but they’re out there, and there has been a bit of a history of server issues on the Assassin’s Creed PC ports. Despite using a machine and broadband connection that is fine for every other multiplayer title I’ve played, checking the game was reporting a good connection speed and an open NAT, allowing the multiplayer executable and uPlay through my firewall on all ports for TCP and UDP, flushing my DNS cache, rebuilding my hosts file, creating an exception for the program in my anti-virus software, and trying to port forward both uPlay and the game, still I’d sit for twenty or thirty minutes in front of my monitor as the program failed to properly connect to any online matches. Maybe there was something more out there I could have done to get my client speaking to the Ubiservers properly, but the idea that it should take this much tweaking to get a game to operate at a basic level when every other game I’ve had runs online with almost no special alterations is crazy. As far as I am concerned the network connectivity of this product is broken.When it comes to Assassin Creed IV’s multiplayer your mileage may vary, and what can be a game of invigorating cunning and misdirection can be hamstrung either by the game’s action-adventure leanings or by embarrassingly severe connection issues. The single-player however is one of the best of the series. There’s a slight aftertaste of lazy narrative work and design-by-committee politics to it, but you still want to be that tower-scaling, collectible-hunting, ghost-like assassin, and your adventures on the open waves bring a sense of bracing freedom and domination of your foes in the only way a pirate knows how. This entry into the series stands out as more varied and original than what has come both immediately before and immediately after.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[Black Flag opens with the pirate protagonist washed ashore, shipwrecked on a gorgeous and lovingly detailed Caribbean island. It's an inviting escapist fantasy location with enough incidental detail to suggest a lived-in history and culture. It made me want to canvas the area and search for secrets. Incidentally, every single object of interest is immediately marked on your minimap, meaning I didn't exactly have to do much besides beeline for icons with extreme tunnel-vision. Immediately the lovingly crafted island was an ocean of nothing placed between collectibles. There was no adventure or mysteries to be uncovered whatsoever. There's just a bunch of stuff to make numbers go up on some subscreen that I'm meant to gawk at and feel... satisfaction, I guess? Satisfaction at a job well done, much like how a janitor must feel at the sight of a spotless bathroom. ""Oh yeah,"" I remembered, ""I'm playing an Assassin's Creed game.""You collect a lot of bullshit in AC4. Treasure chests, missing documents, animus shards, sea shanties, audio logs, animal pelts, golden bananas, jigsaw pieces, bafmodads... Every time you start the game or fast travel the game helpfully displays a list of all the bullshit in the area you have yet to get. The secret joke is that you don't need to get any of them. For the most part they unlock aesthetic trinkets such as multiplayer icons or bits of flavor text that aren't worth reading.There are issues with the controls. There have always been issues with the controls in Assassin's Creed. They are still issues. The hero has an extreme sense of weight and inertia, probably in an attempt to make his actions more grounded in reality. He is slow to accelerate, his turning radius is wide, and there's often a hesitation between the press of a button and the hero's actions. Navigating tight areas can be a nightmare. Full tilt free-running is the only available method of moving faster than a casual stroll, so in areas with a lot of clutter you've got the choice of moving infuriatingly slowly or unintentionally climbing and bumbling over all manner of objects, repeatedly scooting past your target, and arguably wasting even more time than if you had just walked. I've found myself climbing on top of treasure chests I've meant to open. The same chest, multiple times. Once you're squatted on top of a treasure chest it might surprise you how difficult it can be to get down. In summation, the free-running mechanic is roughly the same as ever: too clumsy and stop-and-go to be fluid or exhilarating, and not complex enough to be more engaging than holding in the trigger and pressing forward on the joystick. There's the constant sensation that your inputs are considered mild suggestions against a host of automation processes. When it does work it is unsatisfying because it feels like just that-- a machine that is functioning properly. When it doesn't work it's so much more frustrating because it feels like a machine that has broken down rather than an error on the player's behalf. The tech and animations behind the climbing were impressive back in 2006, and still are to an extent, but there have been so many sequels and so many years between the first Creed and Black Flag that it's hard to remain excited for a movement system that hasn't improved much upon its slightly-wonky-feeling base.Something that has improved over other games in the series is the stealth gameplay. AC4 accomplishes this by actually having stealth gameplay. The whole 'social stealth' theme has been all but jettisoned in favor of a more FarCry-style approach in which you hide in bushes, around corners, or other such ambush spots to take out guards one at a time. You have a small but intelligent assortment of tools, including a dart gun that can be loaded with tranquilizers or berserker darts, the latter of which are fun to put to use. Instead of detection being an inevitable part of the gameplay loop as in past Creeds, ghosting is now very possible. Overall I found the stealthy missions (not tailored around tailing an NPC) to be the most enjoyable this game has to offer. I especially enjoyed the side activities that have you infiltrating plantations-- first to snoop out the guard who holds the key to the warehouse, and second to reach the warehouse itself.Another happy surprise is that much of the game patterns itself after Zelda: The Wind Waker. After the storyline allows you access to a ship, you are free to explore a Caribbean made up of a few dozen islands-- some large, some small. Although it can't match Zelda in the details or in imagination, it's still enjoyable to sail about and chart out new territories. Another favorite activity of mine has you hunting down buried treasure using only coordinates and hand-drawn maps with very little HUD assistance. Like stealth, treasure hunting is one of the few activities in the game that forces you to examine your environment and treat it like more than a dumping ground for collectibles. Plus, the payouts for the buried treasure are good enough that it's worth doing. On the sea you can engage in ship-to-ship combat, which is also fairly entertaining, but since the boat handles like, well, a boat, it lacks quite a bit in finesse and often turns into a damage race. Which cannon you use (front, side, or tipping flaming barrels off the back) is dictated by which direction the camera is looking, and it's somewhat unfortunately difficult to come to grips with. In particular, you are unabile to use your best firepower AND steer the boat at the same time. It's not bad, but not as good as it could be.After pummeling another ship enough you are able to board it and engage in the combat system, which has been reworked quite a bit over previous games. It's styled after Batman: Arkham Asylum, but with a worse camera and less responsive controls. It's not fantastic, but it gets the job done far better than the combat in previous games in the series. Boarding comes with secondary requirements, such as offing captains or destroying gunpowder supplies. One requires you to climb to the mast and tear down their flag. The flag one sucks. I hate it. The boats are the worst thing to climb in a game where climbing is already pretty clumsy.Speaking of things that suck, about 3/5ths of the way through the game you get access to a diving bell. This lets you do underwater missions with terrible swimming controls, a terrible swimming camera, and the expectation that you will do underwater stealth against lightning fast sharks. Sometimes eels will just leap out and bite you and there's very little you can do to avoid it. Luckily, despite the tedium, these are pretty easy to brute force. Unfortunately, some of the best upgrades in the game are unlocked through this terrible, terrible side activity.Oh yeah, there's an upgrade system. Well, scratch that-- there are actually about four different upgrade systems competing for your attention. At the most basic level you can spend money to equip the hero with swords and guns which have stats such as damage, speed, and range to consider. There are so few weapons to choose from, however, that you'll likely pass the lower and middle tiers within the first few hours and then keep the same loadout until the end of the game, when you can finally afford the highest tier. It's not as though combat is challenging enough to warrant managing your loadout.Next you have crafting. This allows you to hunt animals and use their body parts to upgrade elements the hero's person such as maximum health and various types of ammo capacity. Seeking which animals populate which areas and then hunting them is reasonably enjoyable, but it's spread far too thin. What I mean is that each animal you find has only a single purpose. The game introduces hunting with a tutorial where you nab some lizard skins and ocelot pelts. Once you do this, you are done with lizards and ocelots entirely for the rest of the game. This is similar to how crafting in the latest Far Cry games works, and it's just a waste of potential. This isn't a crafting system-- it's just an excuse to make you collect more bullshit.Luckily, the game does provide a singularly good representation of a resource-based upgrade system to use as a positive example. To upgrade your ship, you must gather metal, wood, cloth, and of course money. You can get these by raiding other ships, by stealing from plantations, or by finding minute amounts in pickups scattered throughout the sea. Because you have a small number of resources that can all be spent on a decently sized list of upgrades, picking where you spend what is an actual decision... possibly even a tough one! Because the ship combat can be a bit tricky, the upgrades are things you would actually want.The final upgrade system is the pirate cove. You get a pirate cove, and you can dump money into it to have shops open up there. You don't get any money from the shops, the shops exist in every town already, and you can fast travel way sooner than you unlock the cove. This is a worthless thing to spend money on and I suspect it's only there as a legacy feature from Assassin's Creed II. I appreciate the effort-- and the lack of microtransactions-- that went into implementing all of these upgrade systems, but they're so undercooked and emblematic of the series' deeper issues. Features and systems are just piled on and on and on without much thought put into how necessary, elegant, or worthwhile they are. This game doesn't need four upgrade systems. It can barely manage to make only one upgrade system interesting. You have to wonder whether the game has a ton of collectibles in order to fulfill the systems, or does it have systems in order to make sense of the number of collectibles.Story-wise the game starts off refreshing. Since your hero is a pirate unaffiliated with either side in the series' stupid Assassin vs Templar conflict, there's a fun element of the lore being window dressing for simple pirate adventures. And then, about 75% through the game, the protagonist becomes wracked with guilt over a series of contrivances that are only tangentially his fault. Turncoat allies shout you down, ""all you care about is gold!"" (No shit, I'm a pirate.) Eventually the protagonist becomes an Assassin himself and everything refreshing gets thrown out the window. For some reason becoming an Assassin in these games means also becoming a sullen, joyless prick with a vacuously 'stoic' personality. Obnxiously at this point the game tries to wax nostalgic about itself as characters think aloud, ""remember the good times? When it was just about treasure and pirate adventures?"" Yes, Assassin's Creed 4. I [i]do[/i]. You took them away from me.The story-critical missions are a mixed bag. The best of them are simply about stealthing your ways into, out of, and through enemy territories. The number of times you're forced to tail a target as they meander about is unacceptable, but that's par for the course in an Assassin's Creed game. Estimating in my head, I'd say the hit-to-miss ratio is a shakey 40/60. Considering that there are a ton of missions and the... unfortunate pedigree of this series, that's not half bad. Well, 40/60 is actually a little bit less than half good, but you know what I mean.It's both hard to recommend and disavow Assassin's Creed 4. I feel that the high points are certainly good enough for most anybody, but the low points are low enough to make them not worth it. In any case, if you have even a sliver of love for Assassin's Creed gameplay, you should play AC4. This is undoubtedly the best one so far and likely the best the series will be for a while, if ever.I should note that the very first thing that happened to me when I started a new game was that the introduction sequence bugged and softlocked the game. Furthermore, on one occasion attempting to quit the game hardlocked my entire PC. I've clipped through geometry and had missions that failed to progress. I've spawned into areas with my boat underwater. And for a game that came as a free pack-in with my current video card, it could not reach 60hz while maxed out and performance was still up-and-down with the settings dialed back.]]>"
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"<![CDATA[ I knew it would take me some time to get through AC4, and it did. There were times when I wanted to stop playing, not because the game is difficult, but because it got real tedious in the middle. I've learned that when I'm playing an Assassin's Creed game, I absolutely have to reign in the desire to do everything, and just play the game. Collect things until that gets boring, then do something else. The first quarter was fun, the last quarter was fun, and everything in between was tough to get through. Some of my favorite parts of the Assassin's Creed series are all the weird lore stuff that they hide in the corners of the game, and AC4 did a great job of keeping all that stuff hidden away until the game was almost over. I got bits and pieces of it from all over, but they can't be assembled until you get to the end, which is kind of brilliant. I almost want to play another Assassin's Creed.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Rogue,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed: Rogue is the eighth main Assassin’s Creed game to come out since 2007, and the second Assassin’s Creed game to come out in 2014 alone. This style of fervent production is unheard of outside of sports titles, placing a monumental amount of pressure on development studios to create ungodly amounts of content each year. By sheer weight of probability and statistics, Ubisoft’s breakneck method of production means that eventually the machinery has to break down. Rogue may just be the first sign of danger, and should serve as an important warning to Ubisoft about the impending doom that accompanies this continued production cycle.Rogue sees players taking control of Shay Cormac, an Assassin-turned-Templar. Following a disastrous attempt to recover a precursor relic on the orders of his Assassin Mentor, Achilles, Shay embarks on a quest to ensure such an act can never happen again. The tale of deception and revenge is fairly trite overall; whilst Shay as a protagonist is far cry away from the glory days of Ezio-led escapades. Shay is painfully reluctant to act intelligently at times and is hard to connect with substantially. He is quick to make simple errors of judgement, follows others blindly and falls for the same simple ruse, time after time. By the end short, 10-hour campaign, Shay feels almost hollow. His intentions are unclear, his actions are inexcusable and his consistent stupidity should be decried for decades to come. It’s a story that could have been fixed with a strongly-worded letter half an hour into the campaign, instead of the blood-soaked trail of violence and corpses that follows. I understand that a video game has to have conflict and gameplay to be enjoyed, but plot holes as gaping as these are impossible to ignore and actively insult the audience’s intelligence. Whilst there are certain story beats that are enjoyable and some good mission design in the last few hours, the overall journey is strongly disappointing.In traditional Assassin’s Creed fashion, the actions of the player outside the Animus also tell a story in amongst themselves. Unfortunately, this story in Rogue is simple, bland and repetitive. When your player enters Shay’s memories for the first time, a hidden virus embedded within enters the mainframe of Abstergo Entertainment, forcing a building-wide evacuation. The CEO of Abstergo tasks your character (referred to only as “numbskull”, repeatedly) to continue unlocking the memories of Shay Cormac in order to restore the servers to full capacity.Players of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag will get an unwelcome sense of deja-vu as soon as they leave the Animus for the first time. The outerworld segments once again take place in the main building of Abstergo Entertainment, albeit with significantly fewer people milling about. The player visits the same rooms in the same floors in the same order all over again, playing mini-games to unlock the same types of content and visit the same new locations one after another. It’s both lazy and boring, with a ludicrously poor conceit to explain the actions of the player. It’s a sub-par effort that has no business being in a AAA title in 2014 and actively insults the intelligence of franchise players.The re-use of assets is not unheard of in the Assassin’s Creed series, but it is particularly egregious in this outing. Set in the wintry north-east of late 1700’s America, Rogue takes place in a strange medley of the world of the two previous titles, Assassin’s Creed III and Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. The player still explores colonial America, revisiting New York and Achilles’ homestead, but can also set sail on their boat to the inland rivers around the area, or to the frozen seas to the north-east. These three locations are all segmented off from each other in separate maps, requiring fast-travel between them. Previous titles have engaged in similar actions, but there was a feeling of cohesion between each location. In Rogue, the differentiations in visual style and gameplay mean that the different locales may as well be on different continents.The central framework to an Assassin’s Creed title hasn’t really changed all that much over the past seven titles, outside of the addition of boats. As such, the repetition and re-use of older gameplay mechanics in Rogue feels almost archaic. There are precious few additions to the ordinary open world exploration and collectible hunting, besides from some swapping out of collectible types for something more thematically appropriate. Finding all the collectibles has never been a particularly rewarding goal, but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion upon viewing a fully-synchronised map for the first time. There were dozens of collectibles in my small area alone, meaning there was easily hundreds to find across the world at large. When implemented to their finest, collectibles are designed to encourage exploration and promote discovery of new gameplay tactics and maneuverability strategies. In the Assassin’s Creed series (and more shockingly, across the entire Ubisoft slate of AAA games) they seem tacked on, a shallow way to add a modicum of depth to the world. A new strategy is desperately needed for the future.Assassin’s Creed: Rogue will likely be one of the last titles for Ubisoft to release on the previous generation of consoles. There have been six Assassin’s Creed titles on that generation, which each title testing the mettle of what was truly capable from those aging machines. Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag was one of the best looking titles I’d ever played last year. These points are important to remember when I stress that Assassin’s Creed: Rogue is possibly the worst looking Assassin’s Creed title to date. The shadows on characters flicker in and out of existence multiple times a second, drawing stark attention to the muddy textures and jaggy faces. The framerate consistently drops to unacceptable standards, slowing important chases and fights to a sluggish chug. This is the first title of the series I have played on the PS3, so I cannot say for certain that it is not a hardware-based differentiation. What I can say for certain is that Rogue is neither a good looking nor well running title in any stretch of the imagination.Amongst the sea of familiarity, one particularly intelligent addition to the series is well worth lauding. Since the third title in the series, Assassin’s Creed has implemented a rather intriguing multiplayer spy vs. spy game of cat and mouse. These modes task players trying to discover an assassination target amongst a sea of other assassin’s potentially trying to lethally execute them. The player is given an on-screen indicator that fills as they approach their target, pointing them in the correct direction. When the indicator is filled, the target is in their direct vicinity and ready to be caught.This has been implemented to great effect into the main game during key missions. When infiltrating certain locales, other killers will hide and attempt to hunt down Shay and prevent the completion of his sneaky deeds. Using the detection system from the multiplayer, players have to discover and lure out the hunters before they inadvertently get caught and murdered. It’s an extremely intelligent way of flipping the established standard of hunter vs. prey that permeates the ordinary mission structure in an Assassin’s Creed title, removing some of the overwhelming amount of power available to the player. It’s a gameplay system I would have no problems seeing again in the inevitable Assassin’s Creed 9 next year.By the time I finished playing Assassin’s Creed: Rogue, I was left unsure who exactly the target market is. The game makes no effort to establish the more esoteric conventions to new players, whilst players familiar with the series (especially players of last year’s Black Flag) will feel an uncomfortable sense of familiarity with what they are presented. It’s not that Rogue is a bad game - asides from some fairly shoddy graphics and a fluctuating framerate, there’s nothing inherently wrong. The story is arbitrary and achieves little, whilst the idea of exploring the seas and discovering every hidden nook and cranny once again seems pointless without incentive. The scant few new mechanics, however, are intriguing and can be capitalised on in the future. You won’t have an awful time with Rogue, but you also won’t do anything that you couldn’t experience in a previous title. Assassin’s Creed: Rogue is neither a good nor bad game: it merely exists.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Rogue,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed: Rogue is a game of contradictions for me. On one hand, I really liked Assassin's Creed IV, which is good since Rogue uses it as a template religiously; on the other hand, I achieved 100% sync in IV, which is bad since this meant I'd definitely had my fill of sailing, free-running, assassinating adventures for a while. Rogue simply does not do enough to distinguish itself from its predecessor to be anything other than a mild distraction.In Rogue, you play as Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin who, after being sent on an ill-fated mission by his Brotherhood, loses faith in their ways and joins the Templars and begins hunting Assassins. Shay is a dashing rogue-type protagonist - which is quickly becoming this series' standard - and reminds me quickly of Edward. He is mostly an enjoyable, if underdeveloped character; he made me laugh more than once, but I don't know if I'll remember him come next November.The aforementioned mission which separates you from your Assassin brothers and sister does not occur until about a third of the way through the game. This works to Rogue's benefit as it allows time for the supporting cast to develop themselves. This, in turn makes it more meaningful when you hunt your former friends down and eliminate them, followed by an AC classic: the post-assassination confessional. I didn't break down and sob or anything, but at least Rogue tries to create worthwhile characters, unlike the bare-bones approach AC III delivered. Unfortunately, the conclusion all this builds to is rather disappointing. I discovered that everyone's problems could have easily been sorted if anyone took the time to rationally state their positions, but there needed to be a game here, so that didn't happen.Rogue looks just as good as IV ever did and flaunts it. The opening cinematic follows an eagle's flight through the air and it is rather pretty, despite the old tech. Locales include the city of New York, the developing colonies to the north and the frigid landscapes of Eastern Canada. Each area has its own interesting feel and all look beautiful. Ice-capped mountains look as good as Caribbean islands did in IV.The main gameplay of Rogue will feel uncanny if you have played AC IV. You have a boat (which you receive in the very first mission) and you use said boat to do battle against enemy ships, destroy forts which can then be used as fast travel points, manage your trading fleet and generally just explore the world. During melee battle, you attack, counter and use items to lay waste to your enemies. It will feel warm and familiar if you have an inkling for more excellent seafaring, but cold and sluggish if you had your fill of it in the last game, as I did. Luckily, much of the mission design is interesting and varied enough that I enjoyed my time in the main story well enough. Coupled with that is a new enemy type which livens up the typical seek, hide, kill formula of most situations. They are called stalkers and they will lie in wait in areas an Assassin is intimately familiar with: hay wagons, closets and long grass. You use eagle vision and a directional compass to locate them and take them out quickly. They attack when you stray near, do significant damage and flee afterward. This means that no matter how frustrated you are with a mission, it is never a good idea to rush ahead. It is a simple, sensible and fun way to add flavor to an aging formula.Besides the story, you can occupy yourself with side missions around the world, but again, much will feel familiar. You can take over gang headquarters by killing its leader and cutting the flag; you can do hunting challenges that just involve killing animals on a time limit; hunting down the fragments of a Viking sword results in its obtainment; finding Templar maps and tracking down the locations detailed on them reward you with money or upgrade blueprints; renovations make a return from AC III, being vital to income. There is one side activity worth mentioning. It is Assassin Interception, Rogue's answer to Assassin Contracts. Basically, you need to find all of the Assassins hiding in an area by using eagle vision, then eliminate them before time runs out and they kill your Templar ally. It is a switch-up from the usual, but I never want to do more than one or two in a row, and there are quite a few to be done. Meanwhile, the diving bell missions from IV - which I very much enjoyed - have been dropped entirely. Now, lets talk about the elephant in the room. Every Assassin's Creed, nay, every open world game has its share of bugs, but some really feel like they should have been ironed out beforehand. Two in particular require mentioning: an intermittent hitching every thirty minutes or so, in which the game locks up for a half-second and scares me half to death before playing normally once more; and an issue where upon failing or reloading a mission, all items I used in that ""try"" are still absent from my inventory. This does not appear intentional, as it does not always happen.Assassin's Creed Rogue is honestly a perfectly inoffensive, if uninspired game. It is the ""safe"" AC game this year, contrasted against Unity. It feels cheap to say, ""if you want more AC IV, play Rogue"", but this is more fitting than one may realize. It borrows plenty from its direct predecessor, some of which is to its benefit. Unfortunately, most is to its dry, familiar hindrance.]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Rogue,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed Rogue REVIEWWritten By Tyler Pederson Of all the series under the Ubisoft umbrella, Assassin’s Creed has seen the most entries in the shortest time, by far. This has caused an understandable amount of fatigue with the franchise, and this was helped none by last Novembers release of two entries on the very same day. Unity was released for next gen consoles and PC, and Rogue relegated to the last generation of consoles. Rogue now has it’s day in the PC spotlight, and I find it’s one a little overdue. Where many past Assassin’s Creed titles have ended with infinitely more questions than answers, Rogue is a rare case of a wholly fulfilling single player experience that delivers heavily on plot developments as well as sporting the best iteration of the naval combat to date.Few times have I really cared much for the protagonist the Assassins series places me into the life of. Shay Cormack, the Assassin turned Templar, managed to top that list by the end of his journey. He’s not wholly lovable, and I understand that I had personal troubles connecting with particular characters of the past, but overall I feel the arc present in Shay’s story is one of the strongest in the series history, and doesn't take 3 entries to get there. The care put into a couple of perfectly scripted moments really drive home that this wasn't some half-hearted side story, but one meant to give a true alternate take on things.The campaign is paced quite well, though admittedly not perfectly. There are mechanics introduced more slowly that could have been shown off earlier, but end up playing a part for the rest of the story, and more importantly, the open world as a whole. The games take on combating Assassin’s is truly unique and ends up delivering some of the more heart racing moments the series has seen. Coupled with my favorite take on the Assassins combat system to date, and that includes the slower and more deliberate approach Unity took, it really drives home the most consistently enjoyable gameplay experience I've had the pleasure of stabbing my way through.In no way is Rogue the side story is was written off by many to be. In truth, I find it does the most to wrap up some key plot threads and character arcs when compared to any other single entry. It’s strengths are in part thanks to the games that came before it, but it succeeds in really making something special out of an otherwise unimportant entry. I personally don’t feel it’s a spoiler to tell you that the story is purposefully left open for continuation, and I for one can’t wait to see where the later part of this Irishman's life takes him.The naval combat has seen a good bit of polish as well. No longer was I finding myself caught in a poor position or situation due to the games fault, but always my own. It’s as difficult as it’s ever been, most impressively during some of the forte take-downs. There is also a secondary naval adventure to finish with the ships brought into Shays fleet, and it boasts some of the better rewards of the entire games offerings. It’s scale is stuck in that of Assassin’s Creed IV, but it’s utilized to a better effect here, delivering varied and visually stunning environments that take you to places never explored as other Assassins.I don’t have a ton to say on Rogue that wouldn't dive into a long exposition of spoilers and inarticulate explanations of why I find it so compelling. Instead, I want to recommend you check it out for yourself. It drove home that, to me, the draw of Assassin's Creed is no longer making the biggest world possible, but doing all you can with more limited space and options to create a more fulfilling world. The PC version newly released is, in my own experiences, a very solid port job that delivers a significant step up in the visual department, but as a whole I recommend you play Rogue no matter the platform. It’s a crime that Rogue hasn't seen a port to the current generation of home consoles, but I would be happy to grab it again should it ever arrive. I have no idea which side of the story Ubisoft will continue this fall, but I can tell you I have a strong preference toward seeing what else the Templar's have to offer.Assassin’s Creed Rogue gets an 8.5/10]]>"
Assassin's Creed: Rogue,"<![CDATA[One of my favorite things is taking a story and extending it out, exploring it from every angle and examining every point of interest. I love sequels and franchises that survive solely on call-backs and references; it's pretty much the only reason I watch horror movies at all. So, for me, Assassin's Creed: Rogue has one of the best stories in the series, if not the best. I won't say it's the Forrest Gump of Assassin's Creed games, but it touches on so many different storylines that it improves other games' stories just by its existence. Where Unity is a game you can skip without missing much of anything in the world of Assassin's Creed, Rogue takes you on a tour of hidden treasures throughout that world. Outside of the Animus, the recycled environment feels a little empty this time around, but there are enough pieces of backstory to collect to make it worth wading through the unsettlingly clinical offices inhabited by annoying characters.Even disregarding the story, the gameplay refines a lot of what made recent Assassin's Creed games fun to play and paces upgrades and abilities to allow the player access to most of them throughout the game, rather than leaving the best till last. Whistling from hiding places to draw in enemies was something I missed in Unity after Black Flag, so it was a great thing to have in Rogue. Also, the dart gun, which has been improved with a grenade launcher, allowing the player to affect a group of enemies in one move. The ship is given a couple of new features, as well, with the Puckle guns being a more pliable version of the Swivel guns from Black Flag, allowing the player to aim freely and fire more rapidly. It would have been nice to have the free-running from Unity, but the standard fare is serviceable, with familiar jankiness to deal with. I also enjoyed Unity's combat when it wasn't inside getting stuck in corners, whereas in this game I often found myself resorting to the smoke bomb to disable enemies long enough to stab them.I think the thing I didn't like most about the gameplay were the stalkers, who hide in different spots waiting for you to pass so they can stab you. You can hunt them out with eagle vision, but if you're not paying too much attention or you're moving through an area quickly, you can miss that they're even there before their knife is in your back. The worst part is that they don't even do a significant amount of damage, leaving them as nothing more than frequent annoyances.Overall, Rogue is a mostly familiar Assassin's Creed gameplay-wise, but it explores the series' chronology in a way that none of them really have before. For this, I love it.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed: Unity is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series since the introduction of Ezio Auditore. The massive Ubisoft development team have seemingly stripped every aspect of the series down to the bone, in order to find a way to improve it. Those improvements, alongside the new technology the game is running on, make Unity an absolutely staggering experience. However, that same technology is also the games downfall.Unity, this seventh edition in the Assassin’s Creed lineage, tells the story of Arno Victor Dorian. Having been framed for the murder of his mentor, he is locked in The Bastille where he meets a member of the Assassin Brotherhood. This begins his rise up through the ranks of the Brotherhood to find the real killer, along with taking down the Parisian branch of the Templar Order - who are key figures in the occurring revolution. In true Creed tradition, you’ll be bumping into familiar faces from history including Napoleon Bonaparte, the Marquis de Sade, and Maximilien de Robespierre.The original characters Ubisoft place into revolutionary Paris are instantly more likeable than any from AC 3 or Black Flag. Arno is a jack-the-lad sort -- loveable, quick-witted, and suitably passionate. His love interest, Elise de LaSerre, is his equivalent in every way. They bounce off each other incredibly, making their scenes together some of the best in the game. The other assassins, and their templar opposition, make a great supporting cast. However, in the attempt to make everyone sound European while still speaking English, all the non-player characters sound like they’ve been pulled out of a bad Sherlock Holmes adaptation. It’s either upper-class English accents or cockney scumbag with the occasional merde or mademoiselle.Paris also has its own personality. There are tight city streets and wide open gardens as the city ranges from the poor to the rich. Each district has its own unique landmarks, back alleys, and rooftops. The city itself is massive. You can stand on top of the tiled Parisian rooftops and see every detail, from the smoke seeping out of the chimneys to the bridges on the Seine and far out to the buildings and towers you’ll be climbing at the end of the game. Of course, it’s easier to travel by rooftop as the city streets are rammed with people, this time more than ever. Unity is the first game I’ve played that really takes advantage of the hardware it’s running on; it finally seems that Ubisoft have built the huge, bustling city they wanted to back in 2007 with the first Assassin’s Creed.With the changing of the generation, Ubisoft have tweaked the many of the gameplay systems. Unity still feels exactly as you would expect an Assassin’s Creed to feel, but the tweaks to the mechanics are refreshing and make the gameplay far better than it’s predecessors. Traversal now has a parkour up and a parkour down button. Up allows you to leap longer distances and down allows you to make controlled descents down the sides of buildings, essentially giving you a way to stop yourself leaping from a rooftop and killing yourself in the process. Swordfighting has too been improved with a better parry system and an easier way of firing sidearms and dropping grenades mid-combo. The series has finally implemented a decent stealth system, devoting an entire button to being quiet and a cover system to help hide Arno more successfully. It has to be said that the way I usually like to fight has been removed entirely from the game - no weapon in hand, disarms, and counter-attacks - but it’s not missed.All the new systems, together with dozens and dozens of new animations, lead to the actual playing being easier while making you look like a complete and utter badass while you do it. The easing up in the moment-to-moment gameplay is fine, however, as it makes less of a difference than you’d think thanks to more of an emphasis on an increase in difficulty. Arno can supplement his skill set throughout the game thanks to a newly fashioned upgrade system. Points earned throughout missions are used to purchase new melee, ranged, traversal, health, and stealth skills. You can further customise the way Arno looks, including your assassins robes, equipment, and weapons from a wider selection than ever before, to complement your style of play. Each mission and individual enemy have their own difficulty rating and without upgrading you will barely stand a chance against the bad guys and the mission itself. Before the upgrade trees, you would rarely have a reason to finish side missions apart from your own completionist obsession, but now every activity in revolutionary Paris is vital on Arno’s path to becoming a master assassin.The competitive multiplayer from previous entries has been stripped in favour of co-operative play. Players can join together to take on a number of two-to-four player missions and heists. While they are not exactly much to write home, about they do have a few awesome set pieces and lead to some amazing emergent moments that you wouldn’t get on your own. I am far more impressed by the instantly memorable moments in the single player. The mission design for the assassinations have been adjusted giving you just an objective. It leads to moments where everything goes right, and it’s almost scientific in it’s execution, and moments where it all goes wrong and you get out by the skin of your teeth, which is just as amazing. Of course, Unity also has numerous scripted moments in the form of not only main missions, but Paris stories and murder mystery side missions. Most impressive are the Time Anomaly sections, but ruining any of them would be criminal.This all sounds pretty great, and it was, but my experience was sadly riddled by bugs, glitches, and control issues. A decent number of broken AI routines, multiple instances of getting trapped on or in the environment, and one hard crash back to the Playstation 4’s menu. They are frequent enough to be noticeable but not enough to be excessively annoying. More prevalent were the control issues. It’s a problem I have with every Assassin’s Creed game. With so many actions tied to only a handful of buttons, it’s no wonder that the game doesn’t always do what I want it to do, but I do expect it to be somewhat responsive in fast-paced moments of action and perfectly timed moments of stealth.Looking back on my multiple hours with the game, Assassin’s Creed Unity is fantastic. While some of those bugs and control issues are annoying in moment, when your plan comes together perfectly, there is no feeling like it. It’s the familiar Assassin’s Creed experience that you’ve played half a dozen times before, but with new, better mechanics, a bigger, more lush world, an upgrade system that perfectly combines with the difficulty curve, topped off with scripted and emergent moments that will leave your jaw on the floor. One of 2014s absolute must plays.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[The game takes way too long to load between segments, when you fast travel or respawn. Most of the game is spent watching a black screen with the ""loading"" or ""saving"" logo in the top corner. It's buggy both on game play AND graphics. The story line is so so (but that is the best thing about it). Plus you still have to deal with the typical AC movement system that has a lot of chase sequences where you character wants to jump on every wall you pass next to (or jumps off buildings)...which is acceptable if you DON'T have to wait up to a minute each time you have to replay the sequence.  It should never have been released in this condition and I'm not sure there's a whole lot of work patches will be able to fix.  At least wait a few months and see if they can work out the issues.  ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[I’ve had a scattershot relationship with Assassin’s Creed: Unity. I played through its first half during the initial week of its release before opting to put it down and take a self-appointed break. That lasted for roughly three weeks until I went back and finished it just a few days ago. Now, some of you may be wondering why the gap in-between, but if you know anything about Ubisoft’s latest neck-stabbing opus you can probably hazard a rather accurate guess as to why I felt the need to stop playing half way through. Here was a game where glitches of varying severity hid in almost every nook and cranny; where no play session was safe from something going terribly wrong. In ways in which I can’t recall seeing from a big, triple-A release,Unity was a technical debacle of surprising profligacy. Waiting for a patch or two seemed like a good idea.While the pure density of its crowds is impressive, the technical woes they manifest are less soDuring that first week I came across plenty of issues, it honestly boggled the mind how Unity was let out of the oven when it clearly wasn’t ready. From falling through the world on multiple occasions, to encountering hard lock-ups, becoming stuck in walls and haystacks, witnessing all number of hilarious NPC mishaps and repeatedly cursing to the heavens at its awful and rapidly fluctuating framerate. Many other players encountered similarly troubling afflictions with the internet soon awash with footage of character models gone horribly wrong, NPCs interrupting cutscenes, bodies contorting inside themselves and almost anything else you can imagine going wrong with a videogame. Unity was an indefensible mess.Now, a few weeks and four patches later, things are looking slightly better – almost, but not quite, justifying my decision to take a break and wait for these fixes. It’s still not what one might call a polishedproduct; my first time playing post-patch I had a mission to steal a “scathing review” – of all things – only for the NPC carrying it to become stuck in a wall, forcing a restart. I also fell through the world on two occasions despite the second patch noting this as a particular fix, and encountered a few other technical annoyances as well. On a positive note, the previously dreadful framerate is markedly smoother after the most recent patch, though it does still struggle in certain areas. And this has introduced more complications elsewhere with some egregious NPC pop-in. This was an issue beforehand but now its only exacerbated with Parisians often popping into thin air mere inches away from you.That Ubisoft are giving away Unity’s first piece of DLC for free as an apology for these woes is a welcome gesture, but one borne out of necessity. No game should be released in this kind of condition, even if things have gotten marginally better since its troubled launch.It’s a shame, too, because Unity’s realisation of 18th century Paris is absolutely stunning. After a few years braving the American wilderness and sailing the high seas of the Caribbean, Unity sees a return to the series’ roots, presenting a sprawling European city for you to parkour your way up, over and around. This vision of Paris amidst the historic upheaval of the French Revolution is enormous in scope and rife with violent civil unrest. The skyline stretches for as far as the eye can see in every direction, punctuated by the beautiful architecture of Notre Dame, Sainte-Chapelle and La Bastille. Each street is bustling with life, from angry mobs to merchants selling their wares, while the stark contrast of the rich and poor is clear for all to see with the luxurious mansions of La Marais and the ramshackle shops and desperate beggars of Ventre de Paris. There are even modelled interiors, swathed in gold and pristinely kept, or full of rapturously singing Parisians as a bard livens up a local pub with merry song. That Unity is the first in the series to be developed exclusively for the new generation of consoles should come as little surprise: this is the best Assassin’s Creed has ever looked.I only wish it did more with its setting. While revolution is rampant on the city streets, the story is happy to sit on the periphery of the significant events happening all around you. Paris and its uprising citizens should be a character all their own, but Ubisoft could have set Unity anywhere else in the world and told the exact same tale of revenge (which is becoming a Ubisoft trademark), conspiracy and fleeting romance. You’ll meet a few historical figures on your adventures, like the lascivious Marquis de Sade and a young, determined Napoleon Bonaparte, but just as soon as you’ve met them have they vanished from proceedings altogether. After Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag used its historical characters so memorably, it’s incredibly disappointing to see Unity’s disinterest in anything but a cursory glance thrown their way.The slow pace and animation-priority in its combat can be a source of frustrationInstead, the narrative is keen to hook your interest with this confusing murder mystery. As Arno Dorian, your goals are driven by a personal vendetta against those responsible for the deaths of people close to you. He’s a self-interested assassin so his vengeance has very little to do with the creed he’s sworn allegiance to. This type of narrative can work well (case in point: Black Flag) but Arno just isn’t all that interesting, so putting the story on his back is likely to strain it. He’s likeable, sure, but even his early roguishness turns drab once he becomes an assassin and the story adopts an all too self-serious tone.It’s an underdeveloped tale, too. The conspiracy at its heart is often unintelligible and horrendously plotted, with the targets you’re sent to assassinate given no room to develop. I never really cared why I was doing whatever I was doing because none of it is contextualised in a way to make you give a damn. Even the once-lauded post-kill confessionals have been replaced by scattered memories that are meant to help Arno solve this mystery, bereft of any character. Each assassination is just a way to move you up the conspiratorial ladder; you’re unlikely to remember half the people on it when all is said and done.Even the sci-fi meta story is as inconspicuous as it ever has been, so much so that when it does rear its head it ends up feeling intrusive, further relegating anything post-Desmond to the back of everyone’s mind. Its only meaningful impact emerges in the shape of time anomalies that are basically just an excuse to let you climb the Eiffel Tower. As far as diversions go this is one of the more interesting ones – I certainly didn’t expect to be shooting Luftwaffe out of the sky when I booted the game up – but it’s still just another traversal mission you’ve already played a million times before.This feeling of familiarity is one that permeates throughout the rest of Unity. The core of the series is the same here as it always has been. You’ll still leap across rooftops, blend into crowds, stab people with hidden blades and engage enemies head-on with counter-based melee combat. Eavesdropping missions are mercifully few and far between, and key assassinations take on a more elaborate role as you’re given various ways to take out your target, but that keen sense of over-familiarity is always present.After seven years of playing the same kind of experience you know what to expect by now and it’s a formula that’s showing its age. You only need to look at something like Shadow of Mordor to see how other studios have made strides within the genre. Here’s an open-world game that changed our preconceptions for what the genre can be, while also improving upon the systems Assassin’s Creed once formulised. Traversal in Mordor is fast-paced and fluid; the predatory stealth comes naturally and everything about it is so inherently satisfying in its ease of use. Unity ends up feeling archaic by comparison, like an old relic afraid to reinvent itself.New animations certainly spruce up the freerunning after all these years, and Paris is so intricately designed that bounding from building to building is as fun and gorgeous to look at as it will ever be, but Unity is still plagued by the same problems the series has had since day one. Arno will still stick to surfaces you didn’t want him to stick to, leap in a direction you hadn’t intended and struggle to get through windows like he’s trying to park a caravan for the very first time. The rather belated addition of dedicated stealth only adds to these issues with a clunky cover system that rarely works as one might hope.Playing with friends is definitely the way to goMore is more seems to be the Unity ethos, foregoing anything new or fresh in favour of populating the streets of Paris with as many nebulous activities as possible. Looking at the map is an overwhelming ordeal, I’m particularly grateful to Ubisoft for providing a handy filter or else finding the next story mission amidst this cacophony of markers would be quite the task. If you’re a fan of abundant busy work then there’s plenty here to sink your teeth into. There are even chests to be opened away from the controller, like gold ones that can only be opened dependent upon your level on something called Initiates, a website that tracks how many games you own in the Assassin’s Creed series and how much you’ve played of them. Or blue chests that can only be opened by playing the companion app for phones and tablets. I’m sure that’s fun.At some point early on I knew what every map marker stood for and made it a point to avoid anything requiring engagement with distractions on the periphery of the game I actually bought to play.Elsewhere, character customisation is enjoyable, lending a sense of ownership and tangible progression to your own personalised Arno, but Ubisoft’s overbearing business practises are felt here, too. By spending real-world money you can purchase Helix Points, a premium currency that lets you buy weapons, clothing and temporary boosts without needing to earn in-game cash. They’re called microtransactions but there’s nothing particularly micro about a £79.99 purchase atop the full-priced game you’ve already paid for. It’s gross and shameless, especially since buying these items is essential to progressing through the game. Of course, you can still grind the in-game cash and buy them that way – as I did – but this feels like a system designed around encouraging people to part with more cash than they already have. Ubisoft aren’t the first to do this and they probably won’t be the last, but that doesn’t make it any less off-putting.Fortunately, one of the easy ways to earn in-game cash is by playing Unity’s new co-operative multiplayer. As the one major addition on show, it’s actually rather successful, letting up to four colourful Arno’s run around Paris together with specific co-op missions designed for either two or four players. Each mission is its own little vignette, telling a self-contained story within the time period and allowing you and a few friends or strangers to perform various assassinations, stealthy infiltrations and escort jobs. It can get a little chaotic with strangers since everyone invariably ends up doing their own thing, but if you can get a few friends together the co-op is undoubtedly the best thing Unity has going for it.I suppose it shouldn’t be too surprising that Unity’s one major addition ends up feeling fresh and exciting. While its myriad of technical issues are certainly detrimental to anyone’s enjoyment, it’s the lack of ambition in reinventing its aging mechanics and tired mission design that leave Unitytreading water. Black Flag showed that with a few key design changes this is a series that can still flourish and create fantastic experiences, often in spite of its core mechanics, but Unity’s reliance on them makes it feels like a step back when it should have taken a giant leap forward. The endless possibilities afforded by the series’ time travelling concept will continue to offer hope that Assassin’s Creed can still shine, but it needs to take a long, hard look at itself before that can happen. More of the same just doesn’t cut it anymore.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[It's a shame that ""Assassin's Creed: Unity"", the first game in the series created exclusively for next-gen consoles, is a disappointment. A follow-up to the superior ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"", ""Unity"" was plagued with massive bugs and technical issues on launch day. More than a month later, developer Ubi Soft Montreal updated it with a fourth patch, 6.7 gigs in size (!) that resolved most of the horrible pop-up and poor framerate. The game now performs much better, but it was always the uninspired gameplay and unsatisfying story that didn't live up to the franchise's standards. ""Unity"" is a throwback to the original ""Assassin's Creed"" in that the free-flowing ""parkour"" running requires more than just a button press to maneuver and melee combat has been simplified to just a parry-and-strike system. The customization has been expanded and plenty of co-op story missions have been added. But the stealth aspect, while changed, still has nothing on ""Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist"".""Unity"" tells the story of Arno Dorian, an upper class Frenchman, who discovers his Assassin heritage and becomes determined to solve his father's year's old murder. In the process, he also helps out a love interest who's family is involved with the Templars during the period of the French Revolution. The game's story, while far from confusing, can be a little hard to follow since all the French names will not come easy to digest for Americans. This being ""Assassin's Creed"", there is plenty of intrigue and historical landmarks and figures that serve the story. And once again, you can either read up on their true history files or just enjoy the game. The player's true identity is never really revealed at the beginning of the game. You are simply a nameless person who is given an assignment to find a ""sage"" who was part of the French Revolution by using a newly constructed public ""Animus"". Strangely, for a game set in France, there are no French accents, only British...which is weird.The game is a graphical beauty. It features crowds of hundreds if not thousands of common Frenchmen and women populating the streets. As a result, the city seems alive, but there isn't too much new to the formula. The new ""Helix"" missions, some which take place in WW II, are fun platforming segments and the ""Sherlock Holmes""-like investigations help add variety to the usual AC business. However, opening chests, finding scattered icons and tackling or killing random street criminals can be boring, repetitive stuff. The story missions are good, but nothing too surprising. After the Caribbean setting of ""Black Flag"" and the American Frontier scenario of AC III, the France setting (while beautiful) isn't filled with any new surprises. You can purchase and upgrade ""Social"" clubs which add more missions, but there isn't anything that helps the game from being just another ""Assassin's Creed"" game. Unfortunately, the new stealth controls are clunky and the enemy A.I. can detect you when you least expect it, making stealth unsatisfying.Despite these shortcomings, there is fun to be had despite the lack of innovation. If you have a group of friends, the coop missions can be the best thing the game has to offer. Ubi Soft has created social activity events with this newest AC game as you can create or join a clan and compete for high scores with others. Competitive mode would've been a nice addition to complete the package, but overall, ""Unity"" is good, but not great. In fact, it might be the least satisfying ""Assassin's Creed"" game since the original was released in 2007. But if you are a die-hard fan of the series, it's definitely worth playing. ""Unity 2"", is there is one, should be a much better product though. I'd give this one a 7 out of 10. The lengthy load times and overall familiarity works against it.     ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,<![CDATA[ The over all concept of game is good. It's a big change for Assassin Creed Franchise.But the only problem with the game is that the game contains a lot of GLITCH & BUGS.This glitches and bugs are making the game almost impossible to play.The PATCHES that UBISOFT have released to solve the glitches have actually solved 15% of the glitches.]]>
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[ Bear with me on this one, this game brings in a lot of emotions. It's a bit of a topsy-turvey type of emotional rollercoaster that I feel when thinking of this game, so forgive me if I don't make as much sense as I should, or if I just seem overly conflicted. But before I review the actual game itself, I'll give a slight background so you can see my point of view. One of the first games I ever played for the Playstation 3 was the original Assassin's Creed game. While it did get a lot of positive reception, there was also a bit of negativity in the general consensus of the consumer base. A dear friend of mine said it was extremely repetitive. None of the negativity it received ever really bothered me. Fast forward 8? years and many more titles - all of which I greatly enjoyed - to last year (month) right before Christmas. I put the game in and gave it a go. I'm pretty disgusted. After completing 3, for reasons I won't spoil here, I was left wondering what direction the series was going to be taken. Then upon playing AC 4, I felt greatly enthused. Very pleased, even. While there were a small list of things done that I did not like or agree with, the overall experience was amazing. It was similar enough from the Ezio series and the other games of the franchise that I felt at home, and yet there was much done differently where I felt it was not stagnating. Then I played Unity. While there is a lot to still like about the franchise, I feel that it is greatly stagnating and becoming unenjoyable. While I know of a quite a few reasons why this is so, there's something else elusive about this disgust that I can't actually put my finger on, to this day. To sum up a lot of what I'm feeling, I'll tell you that Unity feels a lot like Ezio game number 4. While on the outside this sounds great, it really should be but it isn't. Why? Because it's Ezio game number 4 with an English-born character in revolutionary France. Not Ezio, not Italy, not good. It's not good because while it captures a lot of what was right about most of the other games, it also captures a ton of what was wrong with them. I deny taking into account the framerate issues that has caused Ubisoft to apologize. It doesn't really bother me too much. Yes, I'd love for it to play at a constant 60 frames, but I won't begrudge a constant 30. A few bad framerate issues before the first patch, none seem to happen now. So fixed for all intents and purposes in my eyes. I don't begrudge anyone else wanting the 60 fps, I'm just not going to knock off any star or give it much more of a thought than to tell you I won't be considering it for the overall review. The thing that bothers me the most about this game is that outwardly, it should be extremely fun. Maybe even just as fun as previous games. I think what Ubisoft failed to do that really is the underlying tone of why diehard AC people such as myself should be bitter about this game is that the past 2 games brought something very new and fresh to the franchise. 3 brought the 1st of the naval aspect of the series, as well as brought a good new character after a great 3 series storyline. Then 4 was great just on its own standing, not to mention it took the naval aspect and blew it up into beyond expectation-level greatness. Two fresh games followed by Ezio 4 with it not being Ezio. Or desirable. I just don't understand what Ubisoft was trying to do here, other than push a game every year. Or two, so it seems last year. It leaves a bitter taste, indeed. Now that this is pretty long-winded, I'll leave by saying that I'm not pleased in the direction the franchise is going. If I could give this game a 1 and a half star, I would. I have gotten very far in the game, and I am usually against not giving a review or recommendation without trying the whole product, but unless the ending is the most amazing thing to ever happen to gaming, I stick by this review. I'll finish this game someday, and move on to playing Assassin's Creed: Rogue. I really hope the series gets much better moving on from here. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Unity,<![CDATA[I just can't seem to stop myself from playing Assassins Creed games. I just have to see all the highs and lows of this series. What I found after seeing the credits in Unity was a game that was trying to recapture the high of AC2 and they failed to do that completely. First up the combat feels off with the addition of the perfect counter mechanic the free flowing combat now feels slow and stilted. Which gave me a reason to use smoke bombs instead of actually trying to fight normally. The stealth aspects was one of the few places that this game had a improvement over the old ones. Now having the ability to duck and use cover allows for more ways to sneak through a guarded area. The story of Arno had a few good moments but none of the characters he meets are very interesting. I won't go into any details but at one point in the storyline something dramatic happens yet I couldn't care about it at all. Next up another nice point towards this game is that it looks great and it isn't a giant broken mess like it used to be. They even managed a fun side objective in the helix rifts that are about collecting data clusters to get a high score before time runs out. Yet that is countered by every other side mission. Most of them are just go here kill/steal/defend something with very little context. Plus this game has so many collectibles I just can't see a reason why anyone would get them all. Overall this game is just boring with very few reasons for anyone to play through it. The issue with this game is that it doesn't do anything to diversify the well worn AC blueprint. It is a mirror from the past with characters you most likely won't care about and a modern viewpoint that is just there so they have a reason to head to another time in history. This game just isn't worth your time but maybe next year will be different?]]>
Assassin's Creed Unity,"<![CDATA[November guarantees us colder weather, longer nights, the unveiling of the John Lewis Christmas advert and, most inevitably of all, a new Assassin’s Creed. In fact this year we have two: Rogue for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Unity for the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Unity is the one Ubisoft really needs to deliver, as they look to launch their most popular triple-A franchise into the current generation with a game built from the ground up to take the series forward.Assassin’s Creed has become stale in the eyes of many, with last year’s Black Flag a surprise hit because of how it embraced its piratical theme rather than because it took the core mechanics of the series forward. Unity is far more rooted in the traditional Assassin’s Creed formula, with a huge city to explore and a bounty of assassination targets to take down. This back-to-basics approach is intriguing because of how it focuses on the series’ core concepts and ambitiously seeks to escalate them. This ambition helps to make Unity admirably open-ended, and it comes with glimpses of evolution. Unfortunately, there are too many aggravating pitfalls to make Unity a recommendable purchase amid such fierce open world competition this holiday season.The focus for creative director Alex Amancio is on what he describes as ‘the three pillars’ of Assassin’s Creed gameplay: traversal, combat and stealth. Free-running mechanics have been tweaked to allow for greater mobility when it comes to traversing the environments. Its most obvious and welcome benefit comes from the fact that you no longer have to seek out a hay stack each and every time you wish to descend from atop a building, as a button combination now exists to make your way down just as easily as you made your way up.At its core, though, bounding around Paris isn’t a markedly different experience from making your way around any of the other cities the series has visited in the past. It’s important to consider a game for what it is rather than what it isn’t, getting around in Unity’s Paris can feel a little archaic compared to the freedom of movement afforded to you in other open-world games.It doesn’t help matters there will still be occasions on which you’ll find yourself accidentally scaling a piece of set dressing or leaping from the wrong angle of a rooftop because of the sheer number of climbable surfaces the game is trying to decipher you wish to interact with. It’s an unfortunate case of ambition producing problems that go hand-in-hand with the system’s new-found potential, and it’s something that permeates much of what Unity attempts to do.Combat is one such area, and also another with which it’s hard not to draw comparisons with other games. Shadow of Mordor unashamedly riffed on Rocksteady’s patented free-flowing Batman combat in order to guarantee that players were capable of leaping from one foe to another with ease, and Unity’s offering feels restrictive in comparison. Despite claims that the combat system had been overhauled, it doesn’t feel all that different from Assassin’s Creed titles of recent years. There still isn’t that much to it – you attack, you dodge, you counter – and it can feel slow and unresponsive when moving from one enemy to another. The ability to chain kills together has also been removed, which only exacerbates the fact that Assassin’s Creed’s combat is still a far cry from the empowering sense of awesomeness you get from The Dark Knight.One area in which Amancio’s team has delivered on the promise of a big stride forward is in stealth. There’s nothing groundbreaking about having your character crouch when holding down one of the trigger buttons, but what it does for Assassin’s Creed cannot be overstated. After seven years of being bound by stealth mechanics that didn’t exist beyond contextual stances (despite a plethora of mission objectives insisting that you remain hidden), being able to crouch at any time is an extremely welcome addition. The ‘last position’ silhouette employed in Shadow of Mordor is also present, and remains a clever and thoughtful idea. It’s rather baffling to see whistling taken out, though, which can make some sneaking sequences longer than they really should be as you wait for enemies to make a move.Central to the motivation behind reworking the mechanics is the aforementioned freedom afforded to you in how you approach assassinations. Whilst Unity still harbors plenty of story and side tasks that it would very much like you to complete in a specific way, the assassinations themselves allow for a far greater degree of player choice and creativity. Your first assassination takes place at Notre Dame Cathedral, and you’re immediately told by your accomplice to ‘devise your own plan’, as if to hammer home the point that you can approach these scenarios however you wish. The inherent unpredictability of an open world makes this freedom both a blessing and a curse, as the most meticulously well thought out plan can be brought to its knees by a spasm in the AI (enemies are, as usual, pretty busted).When such plans do come off, though, Unity is capable of producing the most satisfying moments of sneaky murder in the series to date. Utilizing the warring factions or aggravated peasants to your advantage in order to create a chaotic distraction whilst you lock pick an ornate window and dive into a building under lockdown is genuinely thrilling. Cornering your helpless target having picked off his guards even more so. If you prefer you can just go in all guns blazing/all swords waving and hope for the best, and this variability in approach is supported by the way you can deck out your character.The character of Arno can be customized to your liking. There are a tonne of equipment, weapon and skill options, and it’s neat to experiment. Variables such as health bonuses, damage protection and mobility need to be considered, and each piece of equipment also has a unique visual appearance that can make your decisions as much to with aesthetics as they are with practicality. Your choice of tailoring can also receive a change of colour, which adds a further dash of your own personality to Arno. Equipment and skills are unlocked at a fair rate, although some of it will depend on how committed you are to looting chests and corpses. If you don’t have the required patience then you’re generously invited to spend real money on an in-game currency that allows you to purchase as much of the equipment as you like, which will undoubtedly rub some people the wrong way.This ability to mix and match Arno’s loadout is especially encouraged when playing co-operatively, and there’s no denying the novelty of seeing four assassins crawling up Parisian landmarks in various different guises. There’s also something to be said for infiltrating Notre Dame in matching outfits, allowing you all to look absolutely fabulous as you go about whichever brutal murder you have planned for that particular session. Co-op comes in the form of specific missions, most of which task you with infiltrating a particular area and assassinating a target. They’re well designed and worth checking out, but you can also completely ignore them if you’d rather keep to yourself. Co-op is a neat addition, but it’s not built into the core experience. There’s no drop-in/drop-out open world co-op, just set missions that you access in the same way you would any other task in the game.Whilst we’re on the subject of playing with others, there is no competitive multiplayer of any kind, which will undoubtedly disappoint those who had embraced the feature since it debuted in Brotherhood. I guess there’s Rogue if you’re desperate.That’s not to say that Unity is skimping on content, as Paris is absolutely rammed with things to do. It’s actually quite daunting how rammed the map is with icons. There are the usual healthy selection of story missions, synchronization points, treasure chests, creed contracts, opportunities to renovate businesses and plenty of other collectibles, and Unity also introduces proper side missions for the first time in the series.Proper in the sense that there’s actually a quest log, and you can pick up as many missions as you see fit and track them for completion whenever you feel like a break from the story. These side missions come in the form of investigations, tracking down clues, fetch quests, chase sequences and yet more grizzly murder. Each comes with their own little bits of exposition and it’s most welcome to engage in side content that actually feels fleshed out and relatively significant. Retrieving guillotine heads for Madame Tussaud is silly but does help to further dress up Unity’s world.In terms of story, Unity spins a decent yarn. There’s a typically late title card that heralds you into your role as a member of the Creed, but even the hour or so of prologue exposition beforehand is fairly well done. Don’t worry, you won’t be waiting until the eighth story sequence before you actually get inducted into the order.Despite the wealth of customization options, Arno isn’t the blank slate of a character that you may have suspected. The highly marketed relationship he holds with childhood friend Elise is quite well written, and there’s enough emotional investment to keep you going through to the end despite a number of leaps of logic and plot conveniences that don’t fully convince. It’s a little odd that everyone speaks with an English accent considering the setting, but the cast do an admirable job bringing life to the characters on show.Unity’s narrative also isn’t helped by the inherent issues posed by the game’s more open-ended nature, which can leave the story fairly muddled and lacking in urgency. It remains impressive how Ubisoft’s writers are able to weave historical figures into their Assassins vs. Templar backdrop, though.The modern day exposition running alongside Arno’s adventure is completely superfluous and used only as an excuse for why the game exists. It was much the same in Black Flag, but here it’s delivered in a far more streamlined manner that lacks the same commitment to the tongue-in-cheek, fourth-wall-breaking ridiculousness that last year’s modern sequences so charming.Like every Assassin’s Creed city before it (except the ones in III, obviously), the treacherous streets of Revolutionary Paris have been wonderfully crafted. The intricacy in its recreation is nothing short of astounding, and the increased draw distance really does make the sense of scale hit home all the harder. Being able to enter buildings seamlessly further emphasizes the city’s incredible scope. Once again the art direction is top tier, with the game sporting a soft look, great lighting and a splendid palette that makes it look almost like a painting come to life. Characters also look great, especially in cut-scenes. They’re well animated, and the detail offered to the period-appropriate outfits is as good as you’d expect.So far, so Assassin’s Creed, and because of that it was never going to be for everyone anyway. What makes Unity so difficult to recommend at all is that all those fine visuals have come at a major cost to the game’s performance, something that completely undermines the rest of the experience. There are consistent framerate drops to the low 20s, sometimes frames are skipped entirely, and only interior locations manage to retain the norm without too much issue. Sections with severe lag can become close to unplayable, it’s consistently noticeable enough to be a deal-breaker for some – and this is with a 900 MB day one patch installed.Having large crowd scenes is obviously something the development team were keen to include because of the revolutionary setting, and whilst the number of NPCs on screen is certainly impressive the first time you see it, it soon loses its luster once it becomes apparent that the engine is struggling to cope. It’s especially bothersome during sequences of anything approaching frenzy; it’s easy to lose your bearings during a particularly tricky piece of parkouring if the framerate is chugging.Unity is a flawed game as it is, but certainly one that should provide enough enjoyment for what it still manages to be. It’s a real kick in the teeth that the performance issues are significant enough to make even the game’s best moments difficult to enjoy to their fullest. Thankfully the game’s audio stands up to scrutiny thanks to excellent voice acting and a typically brilliant musical score (there is no singing, and the game is very keen to point out that this is not the same French Revolution as that one with Hugh Jackman). Ambient sounds are also great, with choirs outside Notre Dame and demonstrations against the city’s police force making Paris feel all the more alive.If it didn’t run so poorly, the streets of Unity’s depiction of the French capital feel so authentic that you could probably get away with using it as a teaching tool in schools. Who wants to read text books anymore, seriously?Unity feels like Ubisoft’s attempt at answering a similar question – who wants to play Assassin’s Creed anymore? Well, nobody wants to play anything at 20 frames-per-second, but leave that to one side for now and consider that Black Flag resonated because it placed its focus upon a mechanic that was entirely new (ignore that ships were in III, just ignore III completely actually). To most it was a great pirate simulator that just happened to be held up by an Asssassin’s Creed engine. Plenty of people seemed done with the formula, which is why Black Flag was such a welcome and pleasant tonic.By returning to its roots, Unity is a gamble. There’s a reason many claim to be more excited for Rogue than Unity, and that’s because it’s another game that embraces something so far removed from what ultimately makes the heart of Assassin’s Creed beat. Those seeking open world action adventures are finding themselves drawn elsewhere, looking for something new, or something that does better with Assassin’s Creed’s main tenants. Unity’s ambition has allowed Amancio’s team to begin improving upon the foundations so many have grown tired of, but it’s at an unforgivable cost to performance.Those who are still invested in Assassin’s Creed may be encouraged by the steps Unity takes, but even these are undermined by the abundance of extreme technical issues. Those who have long outgrown the series are unlikely to find anything here to change their mind, either. Strange as it sounds, Assassin’s Creed Unity is a game that is held back both by its roots and its attempts to progress. Even without the performance problems it’s a game that doesn’t quite feel like the final form of some admirable ideas, and with them it often resembles nothing short of a mess.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[It took AC: Syndicate to make me realize something: I enjoyed Black Flag for all the reasons it wasn't an Assassin's Creed game. I loved ship combat and customization, freeing slaves from plantations, and just in general exploring the world. On the other hand, story missions were mostly dull and forgettable, there were a number of unenjoyable side activities like chasing down shanties and bell diving, and the classic parkour Assassin's Creed is known for was kind of bland thanks to the patchwork smaller island towns as opposed to expansive European cities. What Syndicate does for the franchise for the first time really since Brotherhood all the way back in 2010 is advance the core of what makes these games so addicting.If you've played an Assassin's Creed game in recent years, you have a good idea of what you're getting yourself into, so let's cover what is new. The chief new mechanic is the grappling hook. Picture the one from the Arkham series minus Batman's ability to launch him into the air. While this may sound like a small change, it refreshes the series in a major way. It essentially removes the biggest ""chore"" of AC's parkour and allows the player to instantly get back to moving from rooftop to rooftop. Meanwhile, it both quickens stealth combat while also giving players a bevy of new options on how to approach these scenarios. In addition, the Frye twins are given more weapon and tool options than any previous AC game. By the end of the game, you feel empowered both in straight up combat scenarios as well as stealth scenarios, actually to the point the game becomes a little too easy as it goes on. Jacob and Evie have separate upgrade trees, allowing the player to tailor them more toward their respective strengths. Jacob is a little more combat focused, while Evie's strength is her stealth. Each twin has three unique abilities toward the end of their respective upgrade trees. In addition, Syndicate brings back Brotherhood's idea of you controlling your own gang. You can feel the influence of Saints Row the Third Director Scott Phillips here. The game starts with every district of London under the control of the Templars. You complete side activities to slowly take control of these sections of the city, eventually culminating in AC's version of a turf war for full control of a district. Gang members, identified in green and yellow attire, can be summoned any time you see them on the street. You can issue several basic commands to them such as creating distractions or attacking specified individuals. There is also a separate upgrade tree for your gang to improve their health and combat capabilities, as well as improve the rate you collect income. While it's a little basic, it's damn fun to sit back and watch the chaos you can cause with a full on gang war. Where you can also feel the influence of Saints Row in this game is in the design of both story missions and side activities. Remember all those awful tailing missions Assassin's Creed games are usually rife with? There are only a handful of them here. Side activities feel like they are natural extensions of fun aspects of the game. You can partake in underground fight clubs, race horse carriages, free child workers from the bonds of their oppressors, and hunt down key Templar gang leaders, knock them out, then whisk them away via carriage to the police. There is a great deal of variety to these activities, and it wasn't until late in the game where fatigue finally began to set in from them being a little on the repetitious side. Syndicate's plot is both a bit basic and silly and yet quite fun. Twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye are easily the best protagonists introduced to this series since Ezio. While Jacob is a bit of more the typical puckish rogue the series has been known for, he has a zest for what he does that makes him a real joy. Meanwhile, Evie Frye is one of my favorite characters in a game this year. She's a more complex character, both cool and calculating and yet seemingly more brutal than Jacob can be. While for the most part you pick which you want to control, story missions are split down the middle for the pair. Jacob's arc tells the story of him retaking London and assassinating the heads of Templar crime lord Crawford Starrick's criminal empire, while Evie is mostly preoccupied with her quest to find a lost Piece of Eden hidden somewhere in London.Speaking of Pieces of Eden, the ""modern day"" story finally returns to the whole main ""First Civilization"" storyline that hasn't been touched since AC 3 completely botched it After AC 4 went in its own direction, and Unity just flat out flipped a middle finger at players for ever being invested in anything the series was doing, Syndicate kind of dabs its toe in the proverbial water with getting things back on track. You never play any moment that takes place during modern day. Instead, there are maybe fifteen minutes of CG cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game that set things back in motion. Meanwhile, there is a rather clever section of the game that catches newcomers up on the basics of the whole First Civilization plot. It is by no means great, but I prefer them taking ownership of the mess they made rather than dismissing things all together, as AC 4's strategy just wasn't going to work for an annualized game series.While this may not be the most technically impressive graphics showcase of the year, the way that 19th century London is realized in this game is astounding. Thanks to the game's new grappling hook mechanic, they are more free to create a scale and scope to the city that doesn't require buildings to be x big and in y proximity of one another to allow you to run from rooftop to rooftop. Even on the PS4 version, gameplay is so much smoother than the mess that was Unity. There is still a bit of open world jank (one side story mission in particular was painfully difficult to complete thanks to the behavior of NPCs), and on occasion you can feel the frame rate dipping, but this is not a repeat of the disaster that was Unity. Load times are a bit of a problem on consoles on the other hand. Any time you utilize fast travel or die and need to reload, you can experience load times in excess of 30-45 seconds. I won't sit here and tell you that Syndicate is a revolutionary entry that somehow reinvents the series. What Syndicate represents is both an evolution of the AC formula and a back to basics approach. After four lukewarm to bad entries in the series (Revelations, 3, Rogue, and Unity), and a fifth that was really fun, but for different reasons (4), Syndicate has created a framework from which you can see a future for a series that was rapidly running out of steam. In my opinion, this is one of the top three entries in the series. If you in any way enjoyed AC: Brotherhood, Syndicate will be right up your alley. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[ Like pretty much anybody else, I was about ready to call it quits with the Assassin’s Creed series after last year’s entry, Unity. It wasn’t so much that the game was technically disappointing, but on a philosophical and design level the game just wasn’t fun. There was so much to do in the game, but I hardly had a good time doing any of it. Word of mouth and my ability to forgive to a fault led me to putting Assassin’s Creed: Syndiacte into my Playstation 4 this year though, and I can say with some confidence that the improvements made to the movement, combat and mission structure have made this the best Assassin’s Creed I have ever played.Assassin’s Creed Syndicate more than makes up for the sins of it’s fathers in almost every way. Not the least of which being the core gameplay. Much of this is standard assassin fare: climbing buildings, leaping off those buildings and landing on soft Templar bodies to slide a wrist-blade in their back. This time around though, Syndicate has made tremendous leaps at making all of this action much quicker and more satisfying. For example, your assassins are now equipped with a Batman style grappling hook that will zip you to the top of the highest buildings Victorian-era London has to offer. In addition, the grappling hook allows you to quickly move laterally across rooftops. This might sound like it makes climbing obsolete (and it kind of does) but the grappling hook is fun to use throughout the duration of the campaign and it’s immensely satisfying every time one of your characters shoots it and it lets out a pressurized ‘pop’. In addition, the combat is much snappier. The characters might look a little jittery while in the midst of flowing to and from different enemies, but taking on multiple opponents has never been more fun or responsive as it is in Sydicate.Throughout the course of the narrative you will take control of twin assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye, whom you’ll be able to switch between on the fly. The dynamic offered by multiple protagonists allows for some light-hearted albeit run-of-the-mill sibling rivalry shenanigans, since Jacob is written as the more careless of the two and Evie is more of a by-the-books type. More interestingly though, is how the game allows you to level the two characters up concurrently. This means that you’re able to spec each character to your liking. While the game might have written Jacob as the type who’s eager to jump the gun, I threw all of his experience points into the stealth tree, making him my go-to character for sneaking missions, while I levelled Evie into being my brawler. Eventually, the game lets you know that its intentions were for Evie to be the stealthy one by making certain skills character-specific, but I thought allowing the player to take each character in the direction they saw fit was novel. The game was good about giving each character experience even when they weren’t being played so one never got stronger than the other. The levelling system was also great for a player like me who is bad at min-maxing ability trees and ends up spreading points around like a bizarre video game Johnny Appleseed.I would be remiss to sing the praises of this game without talking about how gorgeous it looked. Say what you will about past entries into the series, but Assassin’s Creed games always look fantastic, and Syndicate is no exception. Victorian London will be shown in some absolutely beautiful light. Climbing to the top of a building and looking out across the landscape can make for some incredibly picturesque moments. Go down the wrong alley at night however, and you’ll be treated to some well realized “bad parts of town.” As ever, all of the character animations look great, but can lead to some awkward moments when the player character (or enemy A.I. for that matter) can’t quite figure out how negotiate their body through a door. These are minor complaints however in a game that is otherwise visually stunning.Like I said this is the best experience that I’ve had with an Assassin’s Creed game, but that doesn’t mean that it’s without fault. There were several moments throughout my time with it where I would experience bugs. One moment that comes to mind took place during a side mission in which I was tasked with killing Spring-Heeled Jack. When it came time to fight him however, I was unable to attack. Try as I might to restart the mission, I would always run into the same problem until attempting a full console restart. Things like this would come up intermittently throughout the campaign, which while unfortunate, was not enough to ruin the entire experience.Altogether, Syndicate is just a more enjoyable package than any other Assassin’s Creed game I’ve played before it. The side missions are more fun and streamlined, taking over London is satisfying as you conquer individual districts by completing one of several dynamic side missions before culminating in a Gangs of New York style gang fight, and the adjustments to the combat and movement make the game a faster and more rewarding experience. The meta-narrative has been truncated to short cutscenes that play every few hours reminding you that you’re actually an initiate who we never see working for the modern day assassins. This is fine though, because that stuff isn’t particularly interesting anyway. The real draw of the game is the core gameplay, which is better here than it’s ever been before. I look forward to what’s to come next in the Assassin’s Creed franchise, which is something I haven’t been able to say in a good number of years now.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve done this song and dance nine different times now. Since the franchise’s initial endeavor into the 12th century, we have now made our way all the way up to the 19th century. I have personally played every mainline Assassin’s Creed title since its inception except Rogue, but I’ll be the first to admit that I understand the mass fatigue with the series, but that still hasn’t kept me from genuinely liking every iteration released. The general layout and play method just appeals to me, and Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was no different. It’s a solid new entry, but also comes at the cost of certain regression, that was surely beneficial yet still slightly disappointing.Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is the ninth major installment to be released since 2007, and it may be difficult to remember, but this series began as the spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia franchise. After incorporating a tilted reimagining of Prince of Persia’s baseline mechanics into its own open-world, the first game was released to a mix reception. No one had crafted a game like that first Assassin’s Creed at the time, but it was broadly deemed too repetitive for its own good. Come 2009, its sequel was released to glowing reviews, but deriving from that a formula was born. Every main game that has since come out with the Assassin’s Creed title has been a further establishment on what AC2 originally crafted. That’s not a bad thing, as AC2 was truly a landmark title for the previous generation, but it’s also the root of the franchise’s largest problems.Throughout the early titles was an overarching science fiction story revolving around Desmond, who was the descendent of all these respective assassins. However, after he destroyed the world or something at the end of Assassin’s Creed, also known as one of the dumbest endings to a game I’ve ever seen, the overarching narrative was scrapped. After the somewhat low reception of Assassin’s Creed III, Ubisoft rightfully scrapped the modern timeline elements, and the series as a whole has been trying to find its footing back with the average consumer since. Assassin’s IV: Black Flag was a return to form for many with its creative structure, even though I personally found the boat stuff rather laborious.Assassin’s Creed Unity came out next and had one of the most horrific launches I’ve ever seen for a single game. With its multitude of bugs and glitches, it lead to an official apology from Ubisoft themselves. However, once you got past the various glitches (they were completely absent from the PC version just a month after launch), I found Unity to be the best title in the series yet. It was a return to form back into the stealth roots found in 1, but this time with better realized mechanics, strategic co-op, and jaw-dropping visuals. I know it may not be for everyone, but Unity was simply one of my favorite games from 2014. Syndicate was built around the same general tech as Unity, but was this time not developed by Ubisoft Montreal. Instead, Ubisoft Quebec lead developmental oversight on the project originally leaked as Assassin’s Creed Victory. Come October of 2015, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate saw the light of day.It’s the Industrial Revolution and our twin protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye, are amidst the heart of it all in 19th century London still during the longtime war between the Templars and the assassins. For the first time in the series, vehicles are a major part of the street’s landscape. Welcome to “Grand Theft Carriage,” because London is fully equipped with the latest mechanisms that carried the era along. All of the various gadgets and period structures are historically accurate, a level of dedication I think goes underappreciated for the franchise. Same as every game that came before it, you are friends with every notable person who happened to live in the city at the time important enough to be mentioned in an elementary school textbook. They typically serve as your quest givers, but this aspect of the game serves as one of the few things holding back this version of London from feeling like the city it actually is. Other than that, Ubisoft Quebec has molded a terrific realization of one the world's most fascinating urban settings.The universe is still after the Pieces of Eden, technology supposedly from the first ever civilization, and the hunt is on during the distant past and present. In the present, the Helix player from Assassin’s Creed Unity is contracted to find it before the Templars, but this part of plot is skimmed over a lot and not part of the draw. That comes in with the tale in 19th century London, revolving around the twin assassin duo of Jacob and Evie. The Templars now reign the boroughs, and with the help of their now-dead father’s old acquaintance Henry Green, it’s up to them to fully liberate London and claim the hidden Piece of Eden within the streets of the torn city. Is this narrative any good? Well, it’s alright, nothing particularly significant to write home about, but the game’s surprising strength is its characters. Jacob and Evie, while not as round as Ezio, are believable siblings and a great addition. Add that with probably Assassin’s Creed’s best villain to date, and you’ve got a solid cast of characters that makes up for a majority of the plot’s shortcomings. Like I briefly touched on earlier, the historical figures here feel way more forced than have in previous games. These people often comes across as somewhat jarring, but not enough to hinder the experience in any form. It’s a narrative that doesn’t attempt to grab anything sophisticated, but stays put with a thin yet fun story that’s handled well.It’s Ubisoft game-101, as we are once again here climbing towers, unlocking various skills, and doing a multitude of side-missions. Assassin’s Creed is “Checklist: The Game,” and if that model doesn’t speak to you, chances are that this one game won’t drift you otherwise. Syndicate is very much one of “those games,” but it’s a kind of coherent and structured game that I don’t think I’ll ever personally grow tired of. Combat has become somewhat of a derivative of the Arkham games without the fast-pacing depth, but it is suitable, albeit probably too simple for the average player. The series also returns with its trademark parkour system to maneuver across the roofs of London, once again proving that those viewpoints will never stop leaving me awestruck. This is still the core experience of Assassin’s Creed, and once again, I highly doubt that this new entry will persuade anyone who isn’t into the series otherwise. That said, the use of two protagonists is an interesting alteration for sure. Evie adheres more to stealth, while Jacob is outfitted more for core combat. These characters play largely the same, they earn almost all of the same skills, but it’s their specific equipment that differs. It’s a change that doesn’t rewrite the formula yet also keeps the general structure ever-slightly more fresh, that’s greatly appreciatedPerhaps the most significant pure gameplay addition to Syndicate is the grappling system. The mechanic is fairly straightforward - a grappling hook that you can use to more smoothly trek across the urban structures with the simple tap of one of the bumpers. While this implementation certainly has its own fair share of reliable uses, compared to its Arkham competitor, it’s just too slow. To be fair, I understand that the slower procedure of it coincides with the actual time period, but in order for the gameplay to feel more fluid, this should have been a near instant process in my opinion. That said, the general movement here has definitely been improved, as it’s now to the point that I really can’t imagine their parkour system improving from the solid foundation they now have.That parkour only works when there’s environmental design to compliment it, and the open-world work in Syndicate is competent. This depiction of London is historically spot on, but it suffers from being technically dead inside. Due to our somewhat underpowered consoles, the amount of NPCs roaming around has been significantly downsized, mostly likely due it being the root of Unity’s technical problems. Unity’s design of Paris was my favorite yet because it felt significantly populated, and that was only further realized with the ability to go in and out of a plethora of buildings. Syndicate doesn’t really have that, and while the overall structural designs of the buildings are improved from a gameplay perspective, it lacks the spectacle I really appreciated from last year’s game. Don’t me wrong, I still liked the Carriage elements and reasonable space between the streets, but I just wish these consoles would have allowed them to fill this playground with no limitation.Throughout London, you can participate in a ton of side-missions in order to liberate the city from the Templars. Are these missions any fun? Well, they’re alright, albeit repetitive because there are only a few different kinds. Nearly all of them can be completed by just killing everyone, but they’re still enjoyable in the moment. The overall structure and idea behind the optional content is interesting, as completion raises your loyalty to the quest giver. I personally wasn’t compelled to do every piece of content there was, but I can still see someone getting really drawn towards it.When you’re not off doing odd-jobs for every notable 19th century Englishman, you are probably busy with the franchise’s trademark assassination mission at the tail end of a structured sequence. These have always been the best parts behind every Assassin’s Creed game, and Syndicate is no different. However, this time I feel that the actual gameplay here is a step back in all directions from what Unity established. It’s layed out in a format akin to what’s seen in the Hitman franchise, albeit a bit more hand-holding. You are granted a few different objectives to complete for extra incentives, but the underlining goal is to simply kill your target. When Unity gave the player multiple options to experiment with in order to kill the target, Syndicate’s final scenarios are completely scripted, which is just disappointing. Still, these are by all means moments worth visiting and definitely highlights of the entire game, it just seems like wasted potential to me that they had in the last game.Remember when Assassin’s Creed Unity came out and it looked graphically incredible, but at the cost of a ton of glitches? Well, this time Assassin’s Creed Syndicate has released with little to no bugs, but at the cost of graphical aspects. It doesn’t look bad at all, in fact still quite the contrary, but it lacks the near-lifelike look of the environments, and the frame-rate occasionally takes a dive when the action heats up. From the audio end of production, I’m split. While the music is completely forgettable, the voice acting is some of the best the series has seen yet. The Frye twins in particular present themselves as a convincing duo from Europe with their depicted accents. Now, it’s also worth mentioning that my entire experience has been with the Xbox One version, even though I praised the PC version of Unity earlier. Why? Uplay - that’s why. From the screenshots I’ve seen, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate looks just as amazing on PC, but I don’t think I can recommend the objectively best version of the game simply because of the Uplay service. Many of us strongly dislike Uplay for good reason, and I’m not convinced I’ll ever personally buy a Ubisoft product on PC until they get rid of that system, when we lose all activation to everything we’ve bought. Isn’t DRM great?Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is a solid game, but I don’t think it will pack enough punches for most people who aren’t as into the series. While the new addition of the grappling hook is a widely welcomed feature, it’s a bit on the slow side, and probably too slight of a deviation to bring distanced consumers back. Even though I definitely enjoyed Syndicate, there is no doubt in my opinion that this is a step back from everything established in Unity. All that said, the characterization is great and the setting of London is definitely an awesome playground to control our cloaked duo. I recommend this game to longtime fans of the series for sure, but it still further reiterates all of the overarching issues with the Assassin’s Creed games, and this title simply won’t help those who can’t look past those aspects. I know that I’ll be back for the next game, and for better or worse, you probably already know if you will too.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[ Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a return to form for Ubisoft. Not only is it able to inject new life into the series but it brings the franchise back to where it started; not in terms of story and setting but in terms of structure. Sure, there's new and improved mechanics but Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a solely single-player game. This allowed Ubisoft to focus all of its efforts on creating an well polished experience without having to worry about extra bells and whistles that were only ever met with varying degrees of disinterest. Syndicate (not the last-gen Starbreeze game) is a more focused, polished, and cohesive experience than any of the previous entries in the franchise since Brotherhood. The story makes sense, the characters are interesting, collectibles are manageable, and the side-content is actually enjoyable. Personally, I haven't enjoyed an Assassin's Creed game since Brotherhood (yes, I've played them all), so I wasn't expecting much when sitting down to play this for the first time. The first couple of missions throw you right into the actions and include some big set-piece moments that the franchise isn't usually known for. This combined for an experience which immediately grabbed my attention and interest and refused to let go even when I was finished with the game. The story, while entertaining, is not particularly interesting or deep. The dual protagonists (more on that in a bit) get into trouble at the start and decide to follow in their deceased father's footsteps which leads them to London. Upon arrival they go separate ways in trying to reach the same goal: take back London from the Templars. That's it in terms of story. That thread alone leads you through nine sequences in which all you're doing is killing the henchmen of the guy at the top: Crawford Starrick. The motivations of Jacob and Evie Frye (the playable characters) are simply to take back London. That's fine with me but in doing so, you only see glimpses at a deeper, more nuanced character that never quite develops past the early stages. Jacob and Evie are wholly the same characters at the end of the game as they were when they began, minus thinking differently about their father. On the other hand, the ideology and desires of the antagonists are much more fleshed out. As in all of Assassin's Creed games, killing one of the main targets gets you a cutscene where the newly deceased has a dialogue with you about their grand scheme and how what they're doing is right and you're the bad guy. The way that Syndicate delivers these and what Starrick's true intentions are led me to stop and consider if what I'm doing is truly the right thing. Jacob and Evie never once stop and consider this which is disappointing because that could've added a much needed layer of depth to a story that is otherwise linear and one-sided. All of the story is set to the backdrop of 1800s Victorian London which, personally, is one of the most interesting time periods in our history. Being set in this time opened up opportunities for Ubisoft to insert historical characters that many of us are familiar with such as Alexander (Alec) Graham Bell, Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria, Charles Dickens, and even Karl Marx. No Assassin's Creed game would be complete without shoehorning historical characters into the plot but thankfully in Syndicate, these historical figures are either secondary or completely optional. Alexander Graham Bell is the only character that you see more than once in the main story and he's only in it briefly at the beginning. In my opinion, this bettered the overall experience of the game. I didn't feel like my character was interjected into history but instead I felt like history was interjected into fiction of the game which makes for a more enjoyable and less cringe-worthy overall story (looking at you Assassin's Creed III). The setting and characters wouldn't be nearly as engaging and enjoyable if they looked terrible, which is not something to worry about since Syndicate is the best looking Assassin's Creed game by a large margin. I thought Unity looked alright (after patches of course) but it doesn't even hold a candle to this game. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, bringing to life the city of London and showing off the extreme beauty that came with Victorian Era England. Every building, NPC, and pool of water on the street are clearly defined and you can see all the minor details of everything in the world. As for the animations and voice-over, the game excels in that regard as well. The actors bring emotion to the words that they speak, adding weight to every word which only helps to enhance the experience that you receive. While the animations don't look fluid or hyper-realistic, they are believable enough and smooth. Jacob and Evie Frye are characters that I desperately wanted to know more about at the end of the campaign, because in their own right, they're interesting characters but the story did little to flesh them out. Beyond that, they play nearly identical to one another. They're both master assassins and they share the same set of skills to upgrade. Each of them has three skills that only they can unlock but those are nothing special and don't do anything to differentiate the two. Switching between characters is as easy as opening the menu and pressing a button. Your character is switched on the spot so you don't have to worry about getting them back to where you were like in Grand Theft Auto V. Some story missions require one or the other character but as I said, they don't play very differently which led me to just using stealth on both characters. There nothing wrong with that, but I don't see the point in having two separate characters if they're basically the same. As far as gameplay goes, Syndicate is the most fun and seamless the series has been. Running and climbing up a building is still not as smooth and free as it needs to be, however, it's better than previous entries. That being said, I did at times feel that I was locked to a wall and didn't have the option to move in a direction that seemed reachable. The combat in Unity was a travesty as I felt powerless in most battles. Thankfully all of that has changed in Syndicate which strikes a balance between being untouchable and a being as vulnerable as a child. The rhythm and flow of combat is important in this iteration as you need to pay attention to cues above the enemies' heads in order to know what you should do. If it's yellow and flashing, you counter. If it's grayed out, you break their block. Anything else you should attack. It's easy to get into and get a feel for but one wrong move can throw you off balance and you'll quickly find yourself having to heal. It's a balance that feels fun and rewarding without being overly difficulty to master. The biggest new addition to the gameplay formula is the Rope Launcher which allows you to connect a rope from one place to another. The best comparison is the grapple from the Batman Arkham games but the one in Syndicate behave very differently. You can just fire your rope wherever you want to. You have to look around for ledges or spots that give you the button prompt to fire. This sounds fine except that it's very inconsistent. Sometimes you shoot to a really far away ledge and sometimes you can't get to a ledge that is at least half that distance. Also, you don't automatically zoom towards where you're getting to. You still have to hold forward to get to your spot. These are only minor inconveniences though as this makes traversing a whole lot easier and even makes you feel a little more free when roaming London whereas you feel stuck to walls when regularly climbing. In the previous games, especially Unity, there were so many side-activities and collectibles to get that you honestly couldn't distinguish one thing from another on the map. That's been remedied here. There are better filters for the map but even the base one isn't nearly as crowded as it once was. The collectibles feel meaningful, filling in bits of back-story, unlocking new outfits and craftable weapons and gear. Side-missions are also more enjoyable as they're shorter and easier to complete thanks to the rework of combat. Follow missions are also almost completely gone from the game (there's one or two and they still suck) so there's that as well. The Assassin's Creed franchise is as well known for its going back in time as it is with its modern and more recent history adventures. The ""Present Day"" sequences have usually been less inventive and dull than the rest of the game. Thankfully there are no playable ""Present Day"" moments in this game as they're all relegated to cutscenes which, even then, there's very little of it in the game. Unity had a couple missions where it thrusted you into the future. Not modern day but a more recent time such as the second world war. Syndicate does this as well but puts you in the shoes of Lydia Frye, the granddaughter of Jacob as she works with Winston Churchill to rid London of German spies during World War I. Playing through these segments was a ton of fun. They made me wish for a full-fledged entry in the series set during the time period. The Assassin's Creed mechanics lent itself well to a setting with airplanes, zeppelins, and machine guns creating a dark and more dangerous than ever world to play around in. It felt more real and alive than anything in the base game. Assassin's Creed Syndicate revitalized my interest in the series and has made me look forward to what Ubisoft does next with it. It's unfortunate that the franchise may take a year off now that I'm wanting more but if it means that the next game will be that much more spectacular, I'm all for it. Assassin's Creed was dying off but Ubisoft was able to bring it back. While nothing wholly stood out as the ""most amazing thing ever"", this is the greatest Assassin's Creed game since the early ones so it's worth getting back into. This is one hundred percent worth your time.Score: 9/10Trophy Difficulty: Easy - There is no multiplayer or coop in the game so everything is achievable in single-player. All of the trophies are tied to getting all the collectibles, upgrading, crafting, and story related. There are a few odds and ends but nothing too hard.Recommendations: If you like the Assassin's Creed series, play. this. game. If you're a fan of Victorian England, you will like this game. If you're a history buff, you'll enjoy this game. If you like stealth games, you'll like this game. If you've fallen away from the series, I recommend you give this game a shot.Microstransactions: While there are options in the game for spending real world money, they aren’t shoved in your face and the game never comes right out and asks you to buy anything. The only thing you can get is xp boosts which are not needed by any means in order to reach the highest level.*Note: This game was reviewed on the PS4 but is also available on the Xbox One and PCThis review was originally written for Real Dream Productions.

Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Syndicate is the ninth main entry in the series since the franchise debut in 2007, and the first I've put my hands on since Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag in early 2014. Playing through, it was difficult to take what Syndicate had to offer and where it executes it's ideas well without looking to the past and comparing it to other entries in the series. Whereas Black Flag was a major departure from the traditional open world Ubisoft is fond of creating, Syndicate (without the context of 2014's Unity) feels like a return to form that no one was really asking for. For every improvement on the mechanics, some other portion of them has been hamstrung, and it continues the narrative of a series that is spinning it's tires without being an outright offensive experience -- just a tired, already well tread one.Spoiler: You climb that, synchrionize and jump off it.Set in 1868 against Victorian London, the story inside the Animus follows Assassin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye as they wrench free the city from Templar control, while the story outside of the modern Assassin's struggle with Abstergo, Templars and a remnant of an ancient civilization is conveyed through canned cutscenes between memory sequences. Nothing about the story of the modern day has felt essential since the death of Desmond Miles and nothing about Assassin's Creed Syndicate makes it any different. Your character has been reduced down to a cipher known as ""The Initiate,"" and your only job is to get in the Animus and live out the story of whoever they tell you to in order to locate ancient artifacts. It's all been boiled down to a justification to put you into the past -- as it always has been -- but it's never felt more apparent than with how little agency you have. 19th century London is serviceable, but it's feels as much as template as ever. You'll go into the past, you'll interact with historical characters in distress such as Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin who will give you some side missions to accomplish, you'll climb some monuments and gather some collectibles -- all building into literally hundreds of text entries in a database, should you want to dive into it. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad... it's just that they've done it before. Again. And again. And again.Assassin's Creed Syndicate knows how to MTraversing this world is one of the highlights of Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Addressing issues of mobility that have plagued past entries, Ubisoft Quebec ensures you have a whole slew of methods at your disposal. Horse drawn carriages able to be hijacked fill the streets, turning a mundane run across London into chaotic experience as you barrel through lamp posts, merchant stalls and Templars alike. Vertical traversal is streamlined via a grappling hook that has a profound impact on gameplay. Almost entirely eliminating the now-stale mechanic of scaling monuments in order reveal detail on your world map, the Fryes can pull themselves to the very top of virtually any building in seconds. It's application to the gameplay loop is invaluable as well: guerilla style hit-and-run assassinations are invariably satisfying as you worm through a crowd, bury your hidden blade, slink away and pull yourself out a la Batman in the Arkham series. While the climbing and bounding across rooftops still feels fluid until it doesn't -- mostly when your intended inputs are misread and sends your Assassin careening to their death from 300 feet. It's rare, but still present.Stealth is infinitely more satisfying than the fighting by virtue of speedFor as many ways as the game moves forward with traversal, it's taken just as many back with combat. For a series that has been exclusively about fighting dudes when you're not avoiding them, it's disappointing to see the veritable whirlwind of death and blades of past games slowed to a shockingly plodding pace. Enemies turtle up while defending more and you'll rarely find yourself attacked by more than one enemy at a time. They just don't feel as aggressive as they have in the past and the speed of it all suffers for it. The weapon variety is uninteresting as well. You're afforded the arsenal you've come to expect in an Assassin's Creed game -- your smoke bombs, throwing knives, hidden blades, and guns as of late. It's entirely possible to not engage with the tools outside of when required and still have a good time, though they'll go a long way for making your experience easier. When it comes time to fight, you'll have three options: brass knuckles, AC: Syndicate's prominently displayed cane sword and the kukri machete. Mechanically they all blend together, from the speed at which you fight to their utility, making the only real difference being the numbers on a stats screen. While in the fray and putting these weapons to use, enemies will enter a near-death state before being taken down. Should multiple enemies be in a near death state, they can be chained together into multi-kills. The multi-kills look sort of impressive... at first. By the end of the game, I found myself infuriated any time the much-too-long animations launched, knowing the fight would be quicker without all the flourish.I subjected myself to more of these overly drawn out kills than I'd have cared for because they offer one benefit: increased experience points. As you hack, slash, stab and sneak your way through the game, most of your kills and missions will offer you experience points, which turn into skill points in order to make your Assassin better at doing what they do. The experience system isn't entirely unwelcome and gives more incentive than a touch more money does for completing missions and all of their optional objectives, but paired with some of the microtransactions are in this game, feels a little scummy. Helix credits can be exchanged for XP boosts, crafting resources, and maps for collectibles. Don't have enough from the minuscule amount you'll collect over the course of the game? Don't worry, Ubisoft will happily sell you some. It's feels gross, unnecessary and out of place, but if you're into the whole mentality of 'Time Savers', they've got you covered.Jack the Ripper: I wish I could have.Microtransactions aside, I did purchase the Season Pass when I first started, thinking to myself how much I was really feeling being back in an Assassin's Creed world. The initial download as just the key to unlock access, and figuring out how to actually get at the content didn't occur until the end of the game, whereby all of the weapon and outfit additions no longer had any use. The missions added in feel weak as well, feeling like it added content, but not anything worth seeing. By the time I was ready to move over and give the Jack the Ripper content (launched separately from the main menu) a try, I had already had my fill. I scratched the surface but hardly enough to talk in-depth about it -- it was just too little too late in a game that had already drained me of fifty or sixty hours.All in all, it's not that Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a bad game... It's just that it's another Assassin's Creed game. In 2016, most people who play games have touched one at some point or another and are familiar with what they have to offer. If you're feeling up for diving into hours and hours of stabbing dudes in the face and neck, embarking on innumerable side missions and collecting every and anything Ubisoft can dream up, then you may be ready for Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Just don't come to it expecting to see anything new or that you haven't seen before. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Syndicate,"<![CDATA[When I picked up Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate for the Playstation 4, it was primarily because I had played all of the other primary games in the series (AC, AC II, AC: Brotherhood, AC: Revelations, AC III, AC IV, and AC: Unity) and because it was only $8 on a post Thanksgiving sale. To be honest, I was not sure about starting such a long gaming endeavor, especially given how the series seemed to be struggling to find an identity. What I found when I started playing was a fantastically realized world, but with the same old Assassin’s Creed mechanics.Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate is the telling of a search for a Piece of Eden, an artifact left behind by powerful ruling beings before the time of Adam and Eve. A new initiate to the Assassin Brotherhood is tasked with finding the artifact by reliving the memories of two assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye, in late 1860s London. And so begins the story of Jacob and Evie, a pair coming to London to help the Assassin Brotherhood fight off a Templar threat, but each with their own agenda. Jacob wants to make a name for himself by taking over the gangs of London. Evie, on the other hand, is following in her father’s footsteps by searching for lost Pieces of Eden.This also sets the stage for the variety of missions that will be experienced in AC: Syndicate. Jacob is primarily focused on ridding London of the Templar threat largely because they are controlling the current gangs in the city. Evie’s search for Pieces of Eden also put her against Templars, but mostly because they are also searching for the powerful artifacts. Each progressive mission has you dismantling a piece of the Templar infrastructure or searching London for clues that will lead to the artifact. These missions typically culminate in the assassination of a primary Templar agent. The main story missions are the highlight of the game, each adding to the story of the two protagonists. The assassination missions themselves also offer their own interesting challenges by giving “unique assassination” opportunities that can be initiated by completing certain tasks during the mission. I found myself needing to steal clothes from a guard, help a nurse to get the room keys, or enlist the help of a disgruntled employee. The main story missions did not feel overly repetitive either by task or setting, making their playthrough an enjoyable experience.The side missions of AC: Syndicate are a completely different beast. Like previous Assassin’s Creed games, Syndicate features zones or areas that need to be unlocked to remove the enemy influence. In this case, the areas are controlled by gang leaders that must be ousted so the Frye gang can grow. Each area consists of a multitude of missions (often a minimum of 16), but with four primary mission types of child labor rescue, Templar hunting, bounty hunting, and gang stronghold. Having to engage in these mission types at least four times each to secure an area makes for a very repetitive and, in the end, boring experience. I would not call myself a completionist by any means, often choosing what is fun over “100%ing” a game, but I would contend that even most of that bent would find the gang wars a lot to handle.AC: Syndicate does include other side missions that are given by historical figures. In some cases, the mission givers provide a brief story arc of their own, complete with a few tasks to complete. In other cases, speaking with them simply opens up new random tasks to accomplish on the map. As with any open world game these days, there are also a number of collectible items, from pressed flowers to beer bottles, scattered throughout the London setting.If nothing else, AC: Syndicate is the best looking game of the series. The late Industrial Revolution London has the exact look and feel I would expect from the era. Buildings are taller than they have been in any AC game before, each with their own chimneys bellowing smoke into the sky (though they do not seem to be hot to the touch). Large crowds of people representing every walk of life fill the streets, making the city alive in every way possible. Trains and horse drawn carriages roam the city while large cargo and transport ships sail the river. Many of the buildings have explorable interiors and offer a convenient passthrough going from one side of the building to the other. While I prefer the setting of old Italy in the Ezio story arc (AC II), there is no denying that the Syndicate London is much more technically impressive with its potential fully realized.Gameplay in AC: Syndicate falters a bit only because it is the same gameplay as all the other Assassin’s Creed games. While revolutionary in the first couple of games in the series, the style has been surpassed over the years by those that have improved on hand to hand combat (like the Batman games). Combat is pretty basic with one-on-one conflict a mash-fest on the attack button. Group combat offers little more, with the successful tactic of waiting for the blinking “I’m attacking now” flash to initiate a block and counter attack. Enemy AI does not help the situation, often either not responding to the disappearance of their fellow soldiers or giving up the search for the intruder after only seconds. In fact, the enemies seem far less likely to follow the player onto rooftops in AC: Syndicate than in others in the series, making an escape as easy as climbing a building. This makes combat situations feel effortless, but also has the benefit of the feel of being an elite assassin.Given the increased size of the city, traversal options have increased. Fast travel through unlocked synchronization points still exist, but even these do not feel like enough to cover the landscape. In addition to running and jumping along rooftops, the player also has a grappling hook that can form a zipline from one building to the next or instantly take the player from the ground to the top of the building. When on the ground, the addition of the many carriages to the city streets also means you can Grand Theft Auto your way across town.As mentioned previously, the presentation of the city in AC: Syndicate is the best of any of the series. The detail packed into every area certainly shows the commitment to realism of the era and the improvements in hardware available to run the game. Character models and animations are also very well done, again likely the best the series has seen. The combat moves have been expanded to befit the increased weapon variety in the game, meaning that weapon choice greatly impacts the animations used in combat sequences. The only nit I have with the presentation is that the lipsyncing is oddly off. When speaking, each character looks like they are trying to say the words heard in the audio, but that the mouth animations are cut short somehow, limiting the movement. It is a bit jarring in an otherwise good presentation.Overall, AC: Syndicate certainly provides some steam in the Assassin’s Creed train, giving a jolt to a series that was certainly hindered by a bad AC III, lack of continuity in AC IV, and all around poor experience in AC: Unity. It feels as though Ubisoft might be pushing toward a series resolution with AC: Syndicate as a vital cog in the works. The main story may have a slow start, but it certainly picks up, making the two protagonists more endearing that I would have thought possible. If you have some time to invest (I spent roughly 30 hours with the game, completing the main story and half of the gang wars) and have a history with the Assassin’s Creed series, I would recommend picking this one up.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Origins,"<![CDATA[ The extra year in development has resulted in a game much more fleshed out with a rebirth in mechanics. Origins deserves you taking a look whether you're new to or tired of the past offerings. It truly is a worthy game of the year contender, in this unbelievably great year of games, and it's easily the best Assassin's Creed offering to date (and by a large margin).Combat:Combat is much deeper as different enemies behave differently and are quick to switch arsenals pending on your distance. Additionally each weapon type has different combos and timing so on some you may want to throw out more heavy attacks and others will punish you for doing so. By experimenting you can discover powerful combos with each weapon type. There are more bow types than really feels useful, but the plus is each type has it's own ammo pool. You can spec out your skill tree as you level up to gain additional power with the tactics you prefer. Health is now regenerated outside of combat saving you the hassle of spending on and using health regenerating items. The varied enemy tactics, rewards for fights, and variety/complexity of the weapons bring fresh life to the Creed combat mechanics and is much improved and deep. Also the addition of rpg stats and grades and perks in weapons further deepens the strategy and choices. For instance right now I'm using a slow club I don't feel very comfortable using, but it does give me health on hit which offsets it's slowness.Character:The combat improvements alone would have made this sequel worth picking it up, but the improvements are much deeper than just combat. The world this time feels largely designed around the story and missions surrounding it, making it felt lived in. You can easily sense the people around you built the town in front of you and make up it's ethos and design, whereas in the past the inhabitants felt put in to match the town design, now it feels as if the people around the town built it up. This impression is built by the characters you meet. All the major characters have a background story which is not only told by the individual themselves, but their surroundings, their family if it's nearby, and the way the townspeople interact and speak of the individual. The characters aren't black and white either, they may have smiles around family and friends, but do evil behind closed doors. The animation and dialog in the game does a great job of fleshing out emotions between the characters. You can't help but grin at the child's devoted love of his father, and a wife's love of one's spouse is conveyed with the well done graphics and animations. The time spent giving each area it's own feel and characters has paid off making each area a welcome to visit and actually participate in gaining knowledge of it's inhabitants and structures. If you decide to backtrack and visit a town you have been to you don't simply sense the familiar architecture, you will also remember the characters and creatures surrounding it and their stories interweaving with your own, which is possible because each town has it's own feel not just look. Most games with the amount of content in Origins quickly become a fast click through unmeaning dialog, to get the quest/mission, not true here as most missions have an interesting side story around them and are varied as the characters offering them. The sheer amount of time in developing the quests and quest givers is astounding. It reminds me of the GTA franchise where the amount of characters and story arcs is immense, here it's amazing how they provided the the depth they have with 2 years time.Environment:The above had me sold on this being the best Assassin's Creed yet by a large margin. Then I climbed my first Pyramid and loved the game that much more again. As you run up to a pyramid you get an amazing sense of it's size, it's truly amazing how the developers managed to convey the feelings of immensity and awe while not going overboard and hurting the gaming mechanics. First off you see the pyramids far off and they feel much nearer (due to their size) than they are, you quickly realize this as the journey there takes longer than expected. Then you expect to scale it as you have easily the few story buildings cluttering the world, but this time it truly is a test of endurance. You begin your climb and quickly realize just how big the structure is as a single building block is many times your size, as you walk up to them you quickly realize this is not going to be an easy task. As you climb the camera pulls away and your character sways and if you reach for a hold that's not there your character slides making you want to hug the structure and not fall further. The camerawork and animations to convey all this are extremely well done leading to a sense of being there and doing something monumental. In addition to the pyramids, the variety of wildlife, and their locations, flush out the world giving each area it's own uniqueness and keep the game fresh with new experiences. Then their are numerous environmental details, you have the size and beauty of Egyptian architecture here all fresh and unaged around you, you have many different types of vegetation in the wild, side roads are made of lesser materials than main roads, and roads show the wear and tear of use, there are so many such details and they add to experience.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Origins,"<![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Origins takes a mumble jumble of systems and somehow works them into a (mostly) coherent whole. It is a welcome refresh of the series, both story-wise and mechanically.    I usually do not enjoy open world games. Despite my interest in the historic eras the AC games are set in, 3 was the only one I tolerated to completion. In many ways AC: Origins was tailored for me, in that it is basically an RPG.    The game nails is its story and world-building. AC:O is a story of revenge, as one Egyptian Medjay (cop?) seeks out members of a shadow organization responsible for the death of his son. Where other games often falter by settling into a stale routine, the story here mostly stays fresh by using different narratives and twists. Bayek is a great lead. He growls, sneers, but more welcomingly also jests and grins through his adventures. The range of emotions he shows was compelling enough for me to turn off the hood/veil on his outfit just so his facial expressions are unobstructed. Side characters tag along long enough to be memorable, some of which lead to interesting side quests after their turn in the main story is over.    Make no mistake though, the main draw here is the breathtaking world of Egypt around 45 BC. The graphic fidelity helps, sure, but the environment is inherently compelling. As an RPG, enemies and quests from each region are tied to levels. So while free roam is possible, the game essentially is a guided tour through Egypt: look at these deserts, now climb a pyramid, ever wonder what the city of (spoilers!) looks like, here's nile and her crocodiles, etc. Few settings provide the sense of wonder ancient Egypt has to offer. The flavor texts and side quests also flesh out the era. Any time things start to feel stale, new locations and peoples (Egyptians of different towns and worships, Greeks, Romans) are introduced to spices it up again.    For those still invested, the outside-of-Animus plot is still going, although thankfully sparce. In the end the story kind of resets to a state prior to 3's disastrous ending, with more potential for interesting story-telling in the future.    Some of the mechanics and ui seemed straight out of other Ubisoft games. Big yellow numbers pop up on critical hits. An eagle, basically a drone, can be called in to scan/tag locations/enemies of interest. Tower climbing and a map vomit of icons are unfortunately still present. With it's RPG overhaul, loot system, weapon perks, material for crafting, etc are introduced as well.    A revamped combat system helps to ease series fatigue. The previous Batman-style counter and combo system is replaced with more free-flowing action. The comparison often made is to the Witcher 3 or Dark Souls, but much less polished. The camera in combat can be frustrating, especially since the dodge roll goes way further than in other games. Heavy attacks also have considerable lag, which takes getting used to. Each weapon behaves slightly different, and the limited moveset can be slightly expanded with upgrades in the talent tree. The talent tree also branches into bows (with a good variety of bows) and stealth tools, leading to some fairly powerful upgrades towards the end. Combat, shooting, and stealth are all decent, but not top of the class.    Long time fans may be disappointed that stealth no longer guarantees a one-hit kill. Everything is decided by numbers, which mostly means Bayek's level. An enemy more than a couple levels higher is so resistant to damage, combat or stealth, that speed running is out of the question. In particular, towards the end, I had to halt all momentum in the main story to grind side quests to level up. The problem is exacerbated due to main and side quests almost always being multi-step, and only granting experience at the very end. Being forced to do multiple side quests (around 3 side quests grants one level), I also began to notice more rough edges in the quest designs. Too many missions boils down to going to a marker location and do one of 3 things, then repeat in another location. Sometimes Bayek realistically has no way of knowing where the target enemy/location is, but the game drops a marker down anyways. (The worst example is Bayek trying to find a hyena to retrieve a swallowed object. He shouldn't magically know which hyena to track down.)    Some open world jank is still present, such as floating corpses, AI getting stuck on terrain, and clipping through objects (I am sad to report that although you can pet cats in the game, videos taken of such petting will most likely include at least some seconds of the cat clipping into Bayek's body parts), and a couple strange performance problems. But the issues were not often nor severe enough to take away from my enjoyment.    Even with those gripes, however, AC:O is an overall very enjoyable experience. Somewhat in the vein of AC1 or Mass Effect 1, one can imagine the devs follow the same formula yet clean up certain parts to make an extraordinary sequel (with one concern: not many historic settings are as naturally interesting as Egypt. Will be interested in where they turn to next).]]>"
Assassin's Creed Origins,"<![CDATA[It would be remiss to claim that there were not more than a few quality Assassin’s Creed games during its exhaustive seven year run beginning in 2009. The series has always prided itself on its adventurous historical diversity, mixing up its hopelessly convoluted conflict between the Assassins and Templars with real world figures, events, and locations. There’s really nothing else that captures a moment in time quite like Assassin’s Creed, and even when the series is at its worst there is some serious joy to be had in simply existing in its worlds and marveling at the craftsmanship that brings them to life.Yet Assassin’s Creed has also been just as unwilling to break out of its own mold. One needs only to look at the continued existence of its modern day story, which lost control of itself somewhere around Assassin’s Creed III and has still not picked up the pieces from its bewildering implosion. Or how the games, completely against the nature of the very concept of stealth, did not have a dedicated crouch button until Assassin’s Creed Unity, the seventh main entry. This is a series that has been a truly dazzling spectacle more often than not, yet the narrative and mechanical hitches have always persisted as typical Assassin’s Creed peculiarities.It was only fitting that Ubisoft take an extra year to develop its next title after such a lengthy run of annual releases. Assassin’s Creed Origins is the result. It is a delightful open world journey that is utterly spectacular in its beauty and scale, its gameplay changes meaningful and refreshing. Simply calling Assassin’s Creed Origins a departure for the series would be to equate its significance with that of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, and that would be a disservice to how differently this game plays. Origins is not a brief sidestep, a meander in an unexpected direction. Rather, it is a refinement, a proper evolution that has learned from other games of its ilk.This is most immediately apparent in the structure of Origins, which has far more in common with Far Cry or The Witcher 3 than any other Assassin’s Creed game. Its enormous open world, dotted with various encampments, forts, villages, animal lairs, and tombs, allows for the near total freedom of movement. Origins smartly ditches the minimap that so often undermines a game’s environmental design in favor of a Skyrim-esque compass, drawing you off the beaten path in chase of mysterious question marks indicating proximity to something interesting.This makes for a satisfying gameplay loop of uncovering these locations and clearing their icons off the map. And while the exploration is fun on its own, the overhauled combat and stealth systems actually make direct combat exciting, somewhat of a rarity for the series. With an emphasis on weapon hitboxes, blocking with a shield, and—if you can figure out the timing—parrying attacks, Origins’ combat feels both tactile and versatile. It’s a blessing to say that even when the stealth route fails, fighting it out rarely feels like a frustrating hassle.Along the way, the game’s new loot system will throw a constant supply of weapons and shields your way, and it can get pretty overwhelming. Higher tier gear has some interesting effects, such as poisoning an enemy on hits or health recovery. Some items stack these bonuses to become particularly overpowered, such as a sickle sword I found that bled and poisoned enemies while also dealing more damage with each successive hit.The loot system highlights the variety of weapons in Origins in a way that encourages experimentation. Much like Dark Souls, Origins’ weapon’s have unique animations, attack speeds, and range. Some are well-suited for crowd engagements, while others are better for taking on foes individually. The bows are similarly designed and actually fall into some standard firearm archetypes. The predator bow is the sniper rifle, the warrior bow a shotgun, the light bow a submachine gun, and the hunter bow a middle-of-the-road single shot weapon. Once you unlock the required abilities, you’ll be able to equip two melee weapons and two bows and switch between them on the fly. This becomes a terrific way to try out new weapons in live combat while still having your proven, trusted blade or bow on backup.Origins is the first Assassin’s Creed game to feature an entire country as its setting. Its rendition of Egypt circa 48 BCE is certainly compact, but it showcases the region’s stunning geological diversity. Verdant trees and thick vegetation line the Nile River to the east while rocky cliffs hinder travel in the mountainous mid-west. Elsewhere, the pyramids of Giza emerge against glistening sand dunes, while in Memphis, one of the game’s urban areas, citizens brave crocodiles as they wade across flooded pathways. Expect fewer rooftop hustles and alley crawls, as Origins has far more open space than Assassin’s Creed typically deals in.There’s always something to see in Origins, and the astonishing level of detail means most of it is worth checking out. I grew especially fond of observing the citizens of Egypt as they go about their routines. This began with a mortuary I encountered during a side quest, where I observed priests preparing corpses for mummification. I later encountered a settlement to the west built around a natron deposit, a naturally occurring salt used to absorb moisture during the mummification process. I spent a lot of time strolling through this area, watching as some workers hit away at the rocks to collect natron, their forearms and shins plastered white, while others took to some pools of water to cool off from the heat. When night fell, the workers lay down their tools and retired, some of the them taking a seat with others along the pathways to chat.Perhaps my favorite example was a group of men pulling an enormous stone block to be used in constructing a temple being built at the site. The twelve men, aided by a thirteenth pouring sand in front of the block to ease its transportation, struggled mightily to move such an incredible weight along the logs. When they reached the end of the path, they dropped the ropes and groaned in relief, many of them bending over. One of the workers collapsed to the ground in exhaustion and did not move for probably a minute. Eventually he returned to his feet and hobbled off site.Moments like these, tiny vignettes of the lives of these citizens, do more to enrich the world of ancient Egypt than anything else in the game. The unfortunate truth is that Origins often only seems half as interested in its own setting as it should be. Throughout the game the writing suffers from a serious lack of attention and patience with its world building, and nowhere is this clearer than in the story’s opening moments.Bayek is the protagonist of Origins, the last member of an order of ancient Egyptian police known as the Medjay that was done away with during the Ptolemaic years. Only you wouldn’t know any of this if you hadn’t looked up the information yourself. The game begins with a fight between Bayek and some men, none of whom are properly identified until later, and no context is given as to why the fight is happening. Just as quickly you are thrown into the open world, free to explore the game’s first area and clear out dozens of Greek soldiers without any understanding of why you should, or would even be able to.Bayek is an incredibly capable protagonist, able to scale any building or cliff with ease, and his role as a Medjay gives him at least some narrative justification to help everyone with their problems. He’s also devout in a way no Assassin’s Creed protagonist I can think of has been, and his musings on the gods and how his actions are guided by his beliefs offer some fascinating insight into the polytheism of ancient Egypt. It’s strange, then, that Bayek is able to directly contradict his own beliefs in some noticeable ways. Perhaps there is some justification for his wanton destruction of entire military regiments, but I can’t think of any reason why Bayek, who at one point bemoans the desecration of a necropolis as an affront to the gods, can loot gold and weapons from tombs and homes without consequence. I ended up exploring the game’s tombs without taking anything, so as not to damn Bayek for eternity.Origins’ story begins to hit its stride around the midway point, and there is a pretty spectacular sequence of events at its conclusion. Unfortunately, the game introduces and dispatches its villains so quickly that it robs the story of much of its weight. Bayek’s personal quest for vengeance—not to mention the fact that he’s just a terrifically affable character—and how it intertwines with the larger narrative of shadowy orchestrators of chaos is compelling enough, but its characters are critically underdeveloped throughout. Real life individuals like Cleopatra and Apollodorus are easily the most interesting, but the game also lacks the database of previous games that provides details about its characters and locations. I found myself searching through Wikipedia for historical information more often than I’d like.Most of the game’s side quests suffer from the same shortcomings. The best ones take advantage of the unique setting, dealing with relevant issues involving taxation, cultural differences between Romans, Egyptians, and Greeks, religion, and so forth. Unfortunately, the vast majority of them contain simple objectives and forgettable characters, who gab at Bayek with awkward stiffness and some outrageously animated voice acting. And if you’ve already finished all of the locations in an area, you might be a bit frustrated when a farmer sends you back into a fort you just cleared a moment ago to rescue her husband or recover an heirloom.It’s disappointing that Origins’ story and its commitment to its world could have been so much more, but everything else about the experience stands in their stead. I spent 60 hours exploring every corner of Egypt, stalking and knocking out enemy camps, climbing pyramids, sailing down the Nile, and observing the lives of its people, and almost started a new game when I had exhausted nearly all of its content. If that’s not the best possible outcome for a game as lengthy as Origins, then I’m not sure what is.Originally published July 4, 2018]]>"
Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"<![CDATA[Sixty hours. I've put in sixty hours in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I love Greece, I love ancient Greece, I love the philosophy and culture of ancient Greece, so, when I heard that the Assassin's were headed into the Peloponnesian War, I was ecstatic. I frankly can remember playing Origins and thinking just that, ""Man, wouldn't it be great to play in ancient Greece."" Boy, how I was wrong. I wasn't wrong because the setting doesn't permit the possibility for enjoyable gameplay, and interesting story, and choices that are pitched as having an impact; I was wrong because the very soul of the Assassin's Creed games has been utterly lost. When you start Odyssey, you are greeted with the great King Leonidas fighting at the Battle of Thermopylae, right before the Persians sneak around their flank and kill them. The opening is interesting, it sets the tone and tenor for the rest of the game, but the sheer scope of this game dilutes the value of the main story's themes. As is known by now, after the opening, you are given the choice between playing as Alexios or Kassandra. Both stories appear relatively the same and seem to be merely a skin and voice change for the player's character. However, neither Alexios nor Kassandra, evoke the monkish aspect of the main characters of the Assassin's games that has so permeated gaming culture for nearly a decade now. The classic assassin monk's robes that have been a staple throughout the series are replaced with a greyish-black tunic and the option to equip a helmet, bracers, a chestplate, belt and boots; not the sacred robes we all remember. You start off on the poor island of Kefalonia where you are tasked with dealing with the problems that arise as a result of your caretaker's choices to get involved with a sordid individual given the moniker of ""Cyclops."" You finish him off, secure the island, get a boat, and begin your apt named odyssey. The game introduces you to its aspects on Kefalonia, such as choice, with a rather vicious affair between Spartan priests and villagers on the island whose small village has been burnt to the ground, their neighbors slaughtered, leaving them at the end of a blade and their fate in your hands. The choice here will, as the game promotes, follow you through the rest of the story, and intends to add to the power of this game; however, the model for how your choices are determined and how they affect your gameplay leaves a tremendous amount to be desired and, at particular times, leaving you going, ""Wait, that's the consequence, that is not at all equal to the choice I made, I had no way to talk about that choice, and given that most choices are rather binary, it seems kind of “malakaish” to make you bear the consequences literally ten to fifteen hours later."" By the time you bear the consequence to some of your choices, with just the shear size of the game, you might feel like you have no idea what you did, for example, to be kicked out of a particular city, despite having as many clues as the game can provide. As of right now, this quest line, it actually seems broken. It's not that choices are a bad thing, or a bad idea for that matter, in my opinion, these choices do not seem fully fleshed, they are not complex, and suffer from the common trope in games when choices are sold as having a profound impact, but, when making the choices, you're left with great lackluster, and due to the very size of the game, the choices are unfair. For example, there's a mission where you are tasked with killing one of the games infamous members of the Cult of Kosmos, you are given two options to do this, the one, absolutely resulting in his death, the other with the potential to get rid of him in a significantly less prolific manner. There's no indication in the game's dialogue that this choice will bear significant consequence, nor that you will not have the option to reason with him if you make one of the choices. Then, several hours later, for me, literally fifteen hours later, your choices will have a consequence that, once again, you will not see coming and have no way to reason out of if it causes you trouble and you don't like it. The game's choices certainly have consequences, but ones that will most likely leave you feeling like they're not fair; and, in a game, fairness is not trivial, it's addition is necessary. These choices won't leave you going, ""Woah, that's interesting,"" but rather, ""Woah, I didn't see that coming, it doesn't seem complementary to the choice that I made and, wait... what choice did I make that actually caused this?"" This is coupled with a combat system that, I think, quite clearly takes notes from current popular hits like the Souls games. There's dodging, parrying, and abilities, including a heal ability that is very similar to an estus flask; it's just infinite use, as long as it's cooled down and you have stamina points to activate the ability. At higher difficulties and during boss fights, the classic Assassin's combat where you would dance around your enemies, parry them, counter, and kill, is broken down into dealing damage with strong and normal attacks until they die, often leaving you feeling like your slicing and dicing an enemy that's a sponge. Your brutal stabs will merely result in your enemy getting angrier, rather than killing them. You'll have to whittle your enemies down as though the death of your enemies in this game is the result of a thousand cuts rather than a spear through the skull. While other games like God of War may have a button-mashy combat system, at least it appears as though you're actually harming your enemies, and not merely trying to cut them with a toothpick. You have a plethora of effects to help you in combat, including engravings, but these seem like a literal rip off of The Witcher 3's rune system, except that it's not as fleshed out and doesn't add cool effects to your blade. The combat leaves much to be desired and is often tedious. This leaves one to ask if this was intentional, if the combat was made to feel like a literal grind, especially given that they have booster backs for your gold and xp for each enemy that you kill and quest you complete. The RPG elements have been compared to the Witcher's; however, to do this would lesson the significance and the power that was within the Witcher. As stated above, the choices in Odyssey seems straight up unfair; they're out of nowhere, and it doesn't seem like you had much warning; and, given that the consequence can arrive after tens-of-hours of gameplay, you will have no way to go back to fix what the game is telling you that you messed up; and yes, there are irrevocable consequences to some of the choices you've made with no way to reason about them with the interlocutors that are upbraiding you for that choice twenty hours ago, which you don't remember and no one told you would have an impact. On top of that, your combat roles, Assassin, Warrior, and Hunter, are interchangeable; and, it is quite clear that the two most used trees are assassin and warrior, for the health boosts and boosts that you get in your assassination ability. And if at any time you decide that the archery is finicky and doesn't really offer an interesting gameplay option, simply pay those drachme and reset your abilities on the fly. The RPG aspects of this game are there, but to compare them to the Witcher and the fullness by which that game implemented its RPG aspects, is to shame the entire RPG genre and diminish the steps forward that the Witcher 3 took. The real problem with this game however is that it has lost what made it an Assassin’s Creed game in the first place. There’s no hidden blade, the game is more of an action-combat RPG, rather than a faux-historical assassin simulator, and the narrative is set so far back in the past, with no context to the original trilogy, that it is like a simulation of what an Assassin’s Creed game was, which in itself was a simulation. Trippy, I know. In sum, this leaves it feeling soulless. And unlike the Spider-man game that recently came out for the PS4, this game never lets you, allows you, to really feel like an Assassins. The combat feels like your killing sponges, the RPG elements are not fleshed out enough, and the story line, combined with the consequence system, leaves much to be desired, you perplexed and potentially vexed. There’s a lot I adore about the setting, but the mechanics and gameplay detract far too much for me to forego the bad for the good. While I did enjoy Origins more so than I have Odyssey, I will say that I think they jumped the shark on this one, and it’s unlikely, if they continue this pattern, that we will ever get an Assassin’s Creed game like we use to have in the early Naughts. It’s then ironic that I have to consider a game set in ancient Greece to be a tragedy, but truly, that is what I think this game is, despite other popular games website’s opinions.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"<![CDATA[ Having Assassin's Creed Odyssey come out only a year after Origins rather gives this game a disservice since it is better in just about every way. From how well the open world is set up to how just about every side quest and area makes you feel like you are part of the world. Giving the player choice and more options than ever helps showcase this game over it's predecessors. Odyssey starts of rather average as you are on a large island learning the ropes of the game, from how all the systems work to learning what the overall game is about. Shortly after the lengthy tutorial, the game pushes you towards the crux of the game, dealing with Athens versus Sparta and the Cult that runs in the background of everything in the world. The Cult is this games version of the Templar's from previous games but basically under a different name and more hidden from the rest of the world unlike in previous games. The rest of the story rather falls behind as a majority of the story is trying to find someone and being hit with roadblocks on the way and having one of the most basic endings to a story that can be seen in a main quest.Thankfully, there is much more to this game, and what makes it stand out so much is how well they built this open world. Every single location has their own problems going on, and most of those problems ties directly into either the war going on or somehow dealing with the large Cult. Exploring each island or large landmass has unique things going on and quests that deal with their problems as well as tying into the two overarching themes, the war and cult. One island has people constantly fighting each other because the cult demands it. There's two islands close together and are constantly fighting because Athens and Sparta owns one of them. A location that is named after their exporting of octopus and are terrified of a person they haven't seen in years but are still paying the man. These are just tiny examples of the world building they pull of so well.  When you get to each area, there is the main combat that mostly just revolves around you attacking non stop, then either evading or parrying after each attack since they removed the shield seen in the last game. The combat in some situations becomes tedious because of the bounty system. Killing anyone in the game outside of bandits raises your bounty and eventually will cause Mercenaries to come after you. This makes clearing out some areas a hassle because before you know it there may be two or more of them showing up and are harder to kill than most enemies. A majority of this game though has you dealing with the main quest and a large amount of side quests that don't have you kill many people during them at once. Unfortunately, because of how poorly the main quest ended, there was a need to see what happens when you defeat the rest of the Cult as well as the third overarching goal that won't be mentioned due to spoilers. Finishing these made the ending much better but should've included in the main plot of the game as it answers most questions and doesn't make you feel wanting more at the end of the game. There are many other aspects in this game, including a message board to gather many timed quests which is unnecessary as they dole out very little XP needed to level up in the game. I finish the game, all main story quests, Cult, and an overwhelming majority of the side quests and it took me just shy of 60 hours to complete. Around the 33 hour mark or so I was level 30 and stopped the main quest altogether to explore and get lost in the world. Something I haven't seen this well realized since The Witcher 3.  With some misgivings of the main quest, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is up there with being the best in the series, best world building, and most beautiful game seen in a while. It is worth the time to play and explore, and should definitely be picked up if you are a fan of the series, even though there are still some questions to still be had for where this series will go after this game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"<![CDATA[Assassins Creed Odyssey is the eleventh major title in Ubisoft's annual franchise and in my opinion, might top Assassins Creed IV Black Flag as the best in the series. But is that saying much? No, not really. I'll start with the positives first and say that Odyssey is an improvement compared to 2017's Origins and the rest of the series. It continues the RPG esque gameplay set up by Origins that separated it from all the games prior and balanced out the gameplay a bit by having more tolerable or interesting elements than just the combat, although unfortunately still being incredibly mediocre. Odyssey manages to improve on that while also having a more engaging and cohesive plot instead of being a jumbled mess of flashbacks which only make the story more complicated than need be. Although the story is far from perfect or even good for that matter it at least didn't aggravate me with uninteresting characters and dialogue that infect the other games like a plague (I'd still recommend playing as Kassandra though.) The world is beautiful and graphically impressive but is pretty empty with not a whole lot of variety or unique encounters/situations. And regardless of the positives, it's just not enough to ignore the fact that to the game's demise, once you reach a certain point in the game around level 15, Odyssey becomes incredibly tedious as you grind for hours doing an endless list of chores that are not as horrendous as those found in the series first few installments but are still painfully uninspired in order to level up your character's gear and abilities so you can move on to the next main story mission which at that point just isn't even worth your time anymore. This repetition is such a huge turnoff and makes you want to stop playing the game after around ten or so hours. And what's even worse is Ubisoft knows this which is why they give you such a minuscule amount of XP for side quests and have implemented microtransactions that boost XP gain so you don't have to grind as much. While the turn to this more RPG style gameplay has balanced out the game more it also sacrifices the best thing about the previous games: the combat. The combat in Assassins Creed was always very formulaic only having you press a string of around three buttons in a semi-specific order but the crazy death animations that played after every other kill always made it satisfying and fun and when you stabbed a guy you really felt the impact, your swings and stabs had weight to them, whereas in Odyssey combat is floaty and consists of whacking at an enemy's health bar until they just flop over and die, only getting one of those satisfying animations at the end of each encounter. And stealth combat was always my favorite way to approach enemies in Assassins Creed and that carries over to Odyssey except it's been dumbed down to the point where its no longer engaging in the slightest. The special abilities help with the repetition of combat a bit but all the grinding you have to suffer through to acquire and upgrade them isn't worth wasting your time with, and your movement, in general, on foot and horseback is just really buggy. At the end of the day Assassins Creed, Odyssey is an obvious contender for the best in the series but is still a very short-lived experience and I'd only recommend playing it if you're a big fan of the series because if not you'll most likely lose interest around a quarter of the way through the game.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Odyssey,"<![CDATA[Great game, might be the best Assassin's Creed so far (haven't played Valhalla yet), at least my favorite one for sure.It reminds me a lot of witcher 3 with some Breath of the Wild in there. Not as good dynamic systems as BOTW or as good of a story as W3 but it gets close in both aspects! The gameplay is real climby and combat is good including the assassinations, better than witcher 3. Story is almost up there with witcher 3 for me.Only possible downside is that it might be a bit long, it took me 71h according to the game or 85h according to Steam to get to the end of the main quest and then there is lots of good story content left after that not including DLC. Keep in mind that I didn't mainline the story and I went exploring a bunch.I'm at 90-100h in so far and I still haven't finished all the ""odyssey"" content that the main game offers but I'm getting there and then I still got the DLC to play.If long games aren't what you want then maybe look elsewhere but I enjoyed it all the way.]]>"
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"<![CDATA[Around the 35 hour mark of Assassin's Creed Valhalla the game began to lose me, but then I acquired an ability that completely turned the combat on its head. This ability allowed me to dual wield heavy weapons, an absurd proposition that was as ludicrously powerful as it sounds. All of a sudden I had the power to shear limbs off of enemies with single attacks, pounding them into the ground and looking quite silly doing it. Finally, after nearly two dozen hours of unchanging tedious fighting, I had my secret weapon. I selected my equipment--a greatsword and a golden battle ax--and it was off to the races.But then 10 hours passed, and nothing had changed with my loadout, nor my fighting style, nor the abilities I was using. Then 20 hours passed, and still no change.And finally, as I uninstalled the game at the 60 hour mark with half of the main story still remaining, I couldn't help but wish that Assassin's Creed Valhalla had more moments like acquiring that new ability, instead of just the one. This is the story told by my time with the game, a far cry from the promise of exploration and discovery suggested by its narrative. Its promising tale about moving to a new land and playing politics with its rulers is let down so harshly by the execution of everything else as to be almost offensive.The supporting cast is surprisingly good. These two sheriffs of Lunden are the chillest of them all.In Valhalla, Ubisoft Montreal attempts to cover the Viking invasion of Anglo-Saxon England during the second half of the 9th century. The studio is no stranger to bringing difficult-to-study periods to life in these games, having previously put together a beautiful recreation of ancient Egypt in Assassin's Creed Origins. As is the series' hallmark, Valhalla features historical figures, locations, and battles, and seeing many of these brought to life for perhaps the first time in this sort of medium is fascinating. Whether the real world Ivar Ragnarsson was the Skrillex cut blood-lusting maniac that he's portrayed as here I cannot say, though given Cleopatra's treatment in Origins I wouldn't be surprised if liberties were taken with some of these figures. Still, the game manages to bring sufficient personality to most of these individuals.Valhalla's supporting characters are doled out slowly over the course of its incredibly long campaign. The game structures its narrative around regional conquests. From your settlement conveniently located in the center of England you'll pledge to one territory at a time, which officially begins the questline there. The goal is to gain allies for your Viking clan by making contact with rulers and helping them with their problems. This could mean unseating a political rival from their throne and installing a new king, or helping an existing one with a domestic issue. Characters and factions weave themselves in and out of these stories, and the game does a decent job bringing back characters you thought you might not see again. Having played many hours of Crusader Kings 3 this year, it often felt like I was playing out that game's conflicts from the ground. It also helped me understand some of the political structures at play here; for example, why a bishop might be able to stand in for an absent ealdorman. It's probably the most complex plot this series has attempted to tell, and it's mostly successful.I genuinely wanted to see where this story was going to end up, and Eivor was a tremendously enjoyable protagonist. The problem is that playing Valhalla is so uniformly unpleasant across nearly every aspect of the game. So many of its systems are compromised by poor decisions at worst and experiments that swing and miss at best that it's difficult to know where to begin.The ax and greatsword combo was great, until that too became staleI mentioned the settlement that Eivor and his Raven Clan call home. This settlement, called Ravensthorpe, serves as a hub for various services and is the point you return to whenever you've completed a region to regroup and decide where to go next. Using supplies and materials gathered across England, the settlement can be grown by building and expanding facilities. These facilities unlock features such as longship customization, fishing, and hunting orders. One of the facilities is necessary for turning in one of the game's collectibles, which feels like a bit of a waste of resources. None of these are particularly exciting, nor do they have any meaningful impact on the game; the entire mechanic is largely forgettable, save for the visual improvements brought to the settlement.So Ravensthorpe isn't all that breathtaking, but what of the rest of England? Valhalla seeks to address a criticism lodged particularly against Odyssey by altering how destinations are presented in the game world. Previously in this trilogy the maps were filled with question marks denoting bandit camps, fortresses, towns, villages, ruins, and other locations. These would often have objectives associated with them for collecting treasure and eliminating officers. Valhalla dispenses with the question mark entirely; the replacement is a colored dot system that denotes the type of thing located at a particular point. A yellow dot represents Wealth, a blue dot represents a Mystery, and a white dot represents an Artifact, or collectible.It's not exactly a better or worse system than what came before, but the Wealth and Mystery ""systems"" are notably troublesome. I'll start with the Mysteries, which are outrageously overacted encounters with strangers that only last a couple minutes. Some of these are memorable, but there are far too many time wasters here. The nice thing about them is that they never launch into formal side quests and rarely launch into full dialogue scenes, meaning they keep things moving along. But boy are some of these annoying, and they all require so little thought or input that the worst thing you can do is stack a play session with a bunch of them. Rarely has a path to boredom (or irritation) ever been this quick.Until you get explosive arrows, these walls can only be destroyed by finding a small oil jar, hauling it over, and throwing itThey aren't the end of the world though, not quite as much as the Wealth system is. Here's the thing: Valhalla is not a loot game. But it thinks it is. It has a shambling corpse of a loot system gutted so severely from Odyssey that it's practically nonexistent, but it maintains just enough of a presence to not go away completely. Whereas Odyssey fed a seemingly endless stream of loot drops that offered the chance to dramatically change your playstyle at any moment, Valhalla settles for a small selection of weapons and a limited number of gear sets for armor. These weapons and armor pieces are found at the Wealth icons around the map. Problem is, they're collected so slowly, and are often not better than what's already equipped, that I spent the first 35 hours of the game playing with the starting equipment. There is no longer any sense of progression here, save for being able to upgrade your stuff with ingots. These ingots make up the majority of the Wealth icons, by the way. So most of the time, when you finally get to a treasure chest, the reward is not a usable item but a piece of metal that can be fed into something you've had for dozens of hours to raise its stats by a couple points.I say ""finally"" here, because one of Valhalla's cardinal sins is putting up constant roadblocks to acquiring the pieces of Wealth. I've never played a game with this many locked and barred doors. Locked doors feel like they exist only to extend game time, since the key is always nearby, but still far enough way to require too much effort for what the reward is. Barred doors cannot be unlocked or broken. Instead, you must search around for an access point that is frequently difficult to find and often requires dealing with finicky climbing and navigation. What's the reward again for doing this? Sometimes it's an underwhelming weapon or armor piece. Most of the time it's an ingot for slightly upgrading the underwhelming weapons and armor pieces you already have. And in some especially aggravating situations, the key to a locked door is itself behind a barred door.The Wealth is a nightmare to acquire and I had to force myself to stop seeking these icons out. I don't know if it's a problem with the game's design or my own compulsion, but it's no secret that filling a game world with shining icons is going to tempt even the most fed-up players. Everyone I know who plays these games does the same thing: they clear the map. And it's not a bad thing, so long as the gameplay loop is satisfying and there's a good sense of progression and reward for the effort. Valhalla has neither.I had to take this screenshot to show a friend where to find the ability to dual wield heavy weapons, because the skills are hidden for no reasonThe lack of progression on the loot side of things is not made up for by the skill tree, because it's one of the worst of its kind. The Skill menu takes the form of a bunch of constellations, similar to what you see in Skyrim. Each node on a constellation costs 1 skill point, and they grant paltry, insignificant bonuses to things like attack damage and health. Each constellation has a central skill that will grant new passive and active combat maneuvers. However, most of the skills are deliberately hidden until you acquire a node that connects to it. So it's impossible to actually build your character in any meaningful way, because for some reason you just can't view all of the skills. You literally have to blindly move your way through the different branches of this preposterous system to find what's available.Valhalla also does not have good combat. The game had me questioning why I loved Odyssey's combat so much, and admittedly it's been long enough that I can't pinpoint why. But Valhalla's combat feels off. Its brightest moment came when I acquired that overpowered ability mentioned earlier, but even that became dull after using it for nearly 30 hours. Similar to how Valhalla's treasures hit you with terrible environmental roadblocks, its combat is hindered by frustrating enemies that knock Eivor to the ground and poke him back out of range with spears. Input queuing doesn't seem to function properly, if it even exists. Abilities feel clunkier than they did in Odyssey, and some don't seem to actually work at all. Some faster enemy types are able to dodge everything you throw at them and attack with such a small parry window as to feel impossible to fight.Color-coded light beams replace the question marks of previous gamesThe AI is also shocking, especially during larger fights such as raids and fortress assaults. Your Viking companions can be seen engaging in combat with enemies and doing little to no damage whatsoever. Often during fortress assaults the AI shuts down completely. Friend and foe alike will stand around on the battlefield not interacting, not attacking, not defending, not doing anything. I've pushed battering rams past enemies standing tall, watching stupidly as my companions and I crashed through the gate they were supposed to defend, completely unopposed. During a raid, you need an AI Viking to help you open doors and treasure chests; good luck getting them to obey in a timely manner.Why did I play this game for 60 hours? Probably because that main narrative felt worth it, at least for a time, and it sure does look nice. Valhalla has the occasionally rough looking animation or visual effect up close--fire looks especially gnarly--but it's also filled with stunning landscapes and excellent daytime lighting. Riding my horse along village paths, over rolling hills and through the shadow of towering castles brought back memories of much better games. And that was enjoyable to do in Valhalla. The ferocity with which this enjoyment was dashed whenever there was combat, or an annoying stranger shouting referential humor at a Mystery encounter, or yet another barred door hiding the world's most underwhelming treasure cannot be understated. What an immense disappointment. ]]>"
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"<![CDATA[The Division Vikings Edition just dropped on PC 2 years late aren't you excited to play this boring repetitive game all over again and paying double full price for it, wasting your time grinding in this empty lifeless open world for hundreds of hours while whaling millions in microtranscations on this single player game that's artificially filled with crap to waste your time to encourage their purchase? Aren't you excited to install more bloatware on your PC that ruins your performance and ensures the game you bought will become permanently unplayable in a few years? Aren't you excited to make another account on a crappy privacy invasive service that goes down all the time and bans you for no reason? Aren't you excited to buy this same asset flipped expansion you already own, now on a proper platform without support for any of it's features that actually makes using it worth it?I mean for real this company is just on another level.They haven't made an original game for the past 7 or so years, attempted to permanently destroy with various levels of success everything great they made in the past scamming everyone. They force use of their useless broken bloatware on top of having Denuvo, VMProtect and been the one to popularize always online DRM over a decade ago which they now use to take your games away forcing you to buy the new ones.They refuse to even support full features of their own launcher yet alone Steam except for mictrotranscations, the games crash every 5 mins from memory leaks if you attempt to play but don't worry the cash shop always works flawlessly.They're the one that calls the best platform's business model ""unreasonable"" while literally selling the same game 5 times over every year with 5 different special editions, loads of DLCs, loads of microtranscations and loot boxes, driving every single iconic franchise into the ground by turning them into a weird combination of campaign co-op pvp always online lifeless live services and mobile games only to crawl back once their stock price starts dipping low enough.FFS they're the ones that install anti-cheat in their single player games to force you to buy their boosters and ""time savers"" because they design the game on propose to waste it.Weren't they also looking to sell off their company for some quick cash to Tencent because they have absolutely no idea how to run it and actually make it successful long term? Just sell the IPs to Embracer already and go bankrupt, make the suffering end.Just saying this is probably the weakest, most pathetic Steam comeback out of all of them, just putting out a turd in the corner of a place people actually spend money at won't really make it any more appealing.When's Division Re-scammed, Division with Hackers, Division with Pirates, Division with Cars and Division Tom Clancy's Rolling In His Grave Edition launching so I can add them to the ignore list as well?]]>"
